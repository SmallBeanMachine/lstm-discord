It's my trusty axe.
That's one fancy axe.
There's a lot going on underground.
I can't wait to dig holes.
Iconic, isn't it?
Hey, isn't gold really soft?
A sharpened rock tied to a stick. Hygienic!
Stop! It's time! To hammer things!
Maxwell might be looking for this.
The feather increases the scientific properties of the writing.
I bet the beefalo really like this.
That'll allow the mounting of some smelly animal.
The only problem is the saddle sores.
This saddle really flies!
This could take a saddle off.
How many licks does it take to get to the center?
I like the cut of this blade.
Hack in style!
Shearly delightful.
A trusty axe.
Now I just need an angry mob to join.
A scaled-down weighing device.
Sure beats darkness.
That fire is getting out of hand!
Good thing it's contained!
Nice and comfy.
The fire's getting a bit low.
I should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Well, that's over.
At least I can start it up again.
Something to hold back the night.
This will keep my hands free.
Spooky!
A more civilized light.
Sure beats darkness.
That fire is getting out of hand!
Good thing it's contained!
Nice and comfy.
The fire's getting a bit low.
I should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Well, that's over.
At least I can start it up again.
A wretched stench but excellent visibility.
Take that, wind!
A bottle full of sunshine.
This'll keep my hands free.
This will do wonders for my night-vision!
This fire pit is a conductor for even more... fire.
Good thing it's contained!
This is my best invention yet.
The fire's getting a bit low.
I should put something on the fire before it goes out.
At least I can start it up again.
Tar LampTar Lamp- 
That's a real slick lamp.
Science protects my fires out here.
I'm glad we're surrounded by water.
It's getting low.
Better put something on it before it goes out.
It finally went out.
What a bright idea!
A hat, made of bat.
That fire needs more fuel or it's going to go out.
A hands-free way to brighten your day.
It's a big, science-y 'shroom.
Science makes it light up.
Comboletely burnt.
We could make a prime light source with some primary colors.
Blue is obviously the most scientific color.
I didn't mildew it, I swear.
It's her lucky lighter.
You could fit a whole lot of science in there.
I feel kinda bad for that.
Gives me a net advantage!
For catching bugs.
It makes me hungry just to look at it.
It smells like wet.
It's so warm and comfy.
I get sort of crazy when I don't sleep.
I wove it real tight.
Seems sterile enough.
The stinging means that it's working.
This will keep my hair dry, at least.
North.
South.
East.
West.
Northeast.
Southeast.
Northwest.
Southwest.
Which way am I facing?
Wrapping things up should make them easier to carry.
I need to have something to wrap.
Our supplies are in there!
The fur keeps the temperature inside stable.
Down to bring my temperature down.
A nice place for an afternoon rest out of the heat.
Night is for sleeping, not taking siestas.
It's too dangerous right now!
I'm too hungry for a siesta!
I don't think I could really relax down here.
Nothing left to sleep in.
It won't provide much shade now.
I could manipulate its temperature.
It's colder than ice.
That's a cold stone.
It's quite warm and cuddly... for a rock!
Nice and toasty hot!
This will keep my hair moderately dry, at least.
I call it a thatchel.
I can keep my booty in here.
I hate when food has that not-so-fresh taste.
Down to bring my temperature down.
I have a strange desire to name it after myself.
My hair looks good wet... it's when it dries that's the problem.
Tastes horrible!
Shade, sweet shade.
Take that, bugs!
For the birds.
This little piggy's gone... 
Hook, line and stick!
I always hate when my hair gets wet and poofy.
Down to bring the temperature down.
My hair looks good wet... it's when it dries again that's the problem.
The beating of this hideous heart will bring a ghost back to life!
A scientific breakthrough! The cure!
What a scientific marvel!
Somehow the breeze comes out the back twice as fast.
I can light it to let everyone know I'm here.
It's all scorched.
That teddy bear is moving around. Interesting.
Remind me not to get on Willow's bad side.
It finally fell apart.
A breakthrough in culinary science!
It makes me hungry just to look at it.
This is going to take a while.
It's almost done!
Mmmmm! It's ready to eat!
That can't go in there.
Bees!
It's empty.
I should wait a bit.
It's full of honey.
I should try planting some crops.
Go plants go!
Mmmm. Ready to harvest.
I think it needs to be fertilized.
I have harnessed the power of cold!
I should dry some meats.
Meat takes a while to dry.
Jerky time!
The pot got cooked.
How did it get burned?!!
I don't think anything will grow in a pile of ash.
Meat takes even longer to dry in rain.
The rack got dried.
That is definitely a bucket full of poop.
I'm really going to stick it to those mussels.
I should find a good spot for these.
I need to find some fish eggs for this.
The fish babies haven't hatched yet.
There's a fish!
The fish are still multiplying.
This has been a successful fish experiment!
I'd better start harvesting these!
Water you think it's for?
Need to wait a bit.
It could use a spore. Or a mushroom transplant.
It should keep growing now.
The mushrooms have really taken to the log.
That's a lot of mushrooms!
I might be able to fix it with a fresh log.
The power of science compelled it.
I don't think it can grow in this cold.
Now we're cookin'!
Now we're done cookin'!
It mixes all the food.
This will spice things up.
Should make things a little tastier.
It breaks down objects into their scientific components.
It's even more science-y than the last one!
I am one heck of a scientist.
It measures cloudiness.
I can harness the heavens!
The power is mine!
It looks like pepper.
It won't be doing much science now.
The extra science didn't keep it alive.
Its measuring days are over.
The measuring parts went up in a cloud of smoke.
All quiet on the flinging front.
Fling on!
The fuel tank is getting a bit low.
It's whirring with electricity.
For sea science!
It's putting along!
It's running great!
It's putting along.
It seems to be slowing down.
I can hear it sputtering.
It needs more fuel.
I can get more tar if I used this at sea.
I smelt that!
Fan-tastic.
Mercurial.
To harness the heavens!
Now I can show everyone what I found!
So much for that.
Nothing but ash now.
We can make stone sculptures with this.
Burnt right down.
Not even science could make that into a sculpture.
Ready for sculpting.
We already put something there.
A masterpiece!
We already know that one.
I think tanks are in order.
The science has been lost to sea.
I want to use it, and I want the world to know that I did.
That's one pointy stick.
This seems unsanitary.
Aerodynamical!
Ow! I should try to catch that!
Good practice for my birthday cake!
Just don't breathe in.
This seems fundamentally unsafe.
I don't like sports.
I hope there are no bugs in this.
That is a perfectly reasonable piece of clothing.
This looks really heavy.
It buzzes when I shake it.
This is a nasty surprise.
Hot mail!
It's electric!
Spinning doom.
Now it's extra deadly.
The pointy end goes that way.
I'll need to light it first.
This seems dangerous.
Science takes care of me.
I hope this sword doesn't start to smell...
Nice and dry. This helmet will protect me from the elements.
Arts and crafts!
I'm sure this will hold up great!
The best defense is a good offense.
Now I can't be caught off-guard.
Put a cork in it.
Yeesh. This is kinda creepy.
There's still some goo stuck to the insides.
It's brittle.
Protects my brains.
Science says I'm safe in here.
Well, this will come in handy.
Hopefully there aren't any bugs in it.
It buzzes when shaken.
Pretty fancy hat, that.
It feels very stabby.
It has shocking accuracy.
Nothing like loud noises to help keep the peace.
It makes snooze circles when I throw it.
At least my hair will stay dry.
I should put a bird in it.
That's my bird!
Awwww, he's asleep.
These pigs have pretty fancy houses.
I can see a snout pressed up against the window.
Come ON! I know you're home!
That's not a real carrot.
This seems like a bad idea.
Hmmmm. I guess that'll have to do.
Pickets!
Pointy!
They make me feel so safe.
That's a nice wall.
It's my tickle trunk!
It says 'You are here'.
A fern in a pot.
It's not much use like this. We should place it.
We should draw something on there.
This'd be easier if I had the item in front of me.
I could draw better than that!
All we need to build a nice, sturdy fence.
It's just a wood fence.
All we need to build a nice, sturdy gate.
It opens. And closes sometimes, too.
Not so fancy now, pig!
That's not a real roasted carrot.
That won't do at all.
Burnt!
That trunk was truncated.
Next best thing to a lockbox!
I can't read it any longer.
Look what I made!
It's a sandcastle, in the sand!
What a bore-ing house.
Here be evil.
These would do more good if I placed them.
Sturdy.
Even goons gotta sleep.
Sand technology on the go.
Keeps the water at bay.
Ahoy!
It's broken.
Awww yaaaaa Buoy!
Watertight, just like all my theories.
The place where the ballphins roost.
I have to build it in the water.
I shelled out for the good stuff.
Room for two. Or three.

Don't Starve Together
Birdcage BuildBirdcage- 
Now it just needs a bird.
Who's a good bird?
It's a tickle trunk!
He's looking a bit peckish.
Did I forget to feed you?
Maybe he's just resting?
That bird is definitely deceased.
It says 'Thataway'.
The sign is currently blank.
'Don't play with matches.'
I should put something in there.
A flower in a vase on a table.
It's nice to have a little light.
Did we remember to pick up new bulbs?
Not looking too fresh.
A burnt vase on a burnt table.
All dressed up and no where to crow.
Someone made that strawman eat crow.
Someone MURDERed that scarecrow!
Very light, but surprisingly tough.
Spacey and smooth!
It's scalding!
It holds dark, forbidden secrets...
That's burning fast!
It's outta style now.
I don't want to change right now.
It's too dangerous right now!
It can only handle one style change at a time.
A succulent in a pot.
Looks fit for a swamp king!
There was something fishy about that throne anyway.
Just what is she planning?
I suppose we'll never know what it was for now.
Some short lengths of rope.
Boards.
I've made them seductively smooth.
Some sheets of paper.
It contains the mysteries of the universe.
This stuff is crazy!
Beeswax is a scientifically proven preservative!
Some sheets of wax paper.
Soft cloth made from hard root!
Looks like a useful building material.
Just an empty bottle.
I want nubbin to do with that.
Science at work.
Seductively smooth.
I should stick something shiny in it. For research.
I traded the old family cow for it.
I'm making a quillt!
What a handsome devil!
Who would name something that?
What have I created?
I can serenade the animals.
It gives off a spooky light.
Wearing this makes me feel safe and insecure.
I dreamed it myself!
I should have added a beefalo bell.
I bet I could fly if I held two of these.
A soggy, sustaining, succulent suit.
Cool as ice!
It's whispering to me.
I feel so safe when I'm wearing it.
I don't want to set the world on fire.
It's cold to the touch.
It can show me the world.
It's ready to go.
It needs more purple gems.
Looks ready.
It needs a gem.
Not much use anymore.
Fire doesn't really solve naming issues...
Whatever it was, it's burnt now.
Dingalingaling.
It's twisting my tongue.
Fire doesn't really solve naming issues...
Is it dripping...?
More science for my brain!

Pugalisk WandPugalisk Wand- 
Sends shivers down my spine.
Entrance-ing.
That's exit-ing!
It's alive. ALIVE!
It rooted out all my things!
Ha ha! Take that nightmares!
To serenade the animals.
Wearing that makes me feel safe and insecure.
Why would anyone make this? It's terrifying.
We should add a beefalo bell.
I bet I could fly if I held two of them.
I feel so safe when I get to wear it.
That could reveal the world.
That's an entirely scientific mapping tool.
Water amplifies the science, allowing us to measure the moon.
It's a new moon.
The moon is waxing.
It's a full moon.
The moon is waning.
There's no moon down here to measure.
This pyramid controls the sands.
Ready for departiculation.
I guess science works differently up North.
That thing's giving ME goosebumps!
A perfectly normal cursed moose thing.
Darn it! Darn it all to heck!
At least my ears won't get cold...
Hats always ruin my hair.
That's a case of hat-hair waiting to happen.
This should keep me protected.
I AM A BIRD!
It'll be good for when winter comes.
What a nice hat.
This vest is dapper as all get-out.
Wilderness casual.
Winter survival gear.
It's kind of scratchy.
It smells like prettiness.
It makes walking seem much easier!
Ears hat!
Let the juice run down your face.
Stay cool, boy.
Keeps the rain where it ought to be. Outside my body.
It'll mess up my hair, but I'll stay nice and dry.
Keep off, evil sun!
It's not lab-safe!
It will watch over me.
Welcome to hibernation station!
Two brains means double the ideas!
Should repel the rain.
How fashionable!
Well, it's something.
The wind doesn't stand a chance!
I'll pitch a fit if I have to wear that.
Sucks all the stink out.
It really cuts through the air!
What a dangerous looking hat.
The second umbrella keeps the first umbrella dry.
Now I can breath anywhere.
Pithy.
Does this hat make me look scientific?
Makes you warm and fuzzy inside. Outside, too.
Protects your skin, but squashes your meticulous coiffure.
BECOME THE BIRD!
Technically walking is just controlled falling.
Keeps the rain where it ought to be. Outside your body.
Messy hair... the terrible price of dryness.
It watches over the wearer.
What a stylish pair of goggles.
Quality eye protection.
Makes the wearer look like a fun guy.
Sometimes you have to feel worse to feel better.
Finally, I can show my face in public.
I wonder where this is from?
A solid piece of history.
An ancient piece of wall.
All is well.
Getting pretty magical around here.
I think it's becoming more concentrated!
It seems to be staying steady.
Feels like it's receding.
The nightmare is almost gone!
There's no magic around here.
Teleportation can be so useful.
Warm to the touch.
Just when I thought I couldn't get any better.
This beats walking.
I put a gem on a stick.
This will come in handy.
It's brilliant!
Fit for a king. Or me.
It's oddly light.
It has quite a heft to it.
I think it's sleeping.
I hope it doesn't turn on me.
It's becoming more concentrated!
No base should be without one!
A genius invention... a gem on a stick.
How's my hair?
This looks... boat-like...
This looks... adequate...
It runs on elbow grease.
It has room for all my stuff!
That is one durable boat.
A mere shell of a ship.
A vessel fit for a scallywag.
This will add some float to my boat.
This should really transform my boating experience.
That wind isn't getting away now!
Scale it and sail it!
It's feather-light!
This is how a scientist should travel.
The only thing better than a boat is a boat with a cannon.
Does my ingenuity know no bounds?!
For the deadliest catch.
It's not in shipshape right now.
For keeping my ships in tiptop shape!
I'll need to refill that soon.
I have to turn it on.
It's running smoothly.
I need to refuel that.
Nothing but net.
It's bulging with potential!
I think it's sinking.
It is definitely sinking.
I spy with my little eye...
I can see forever!
The proper boating attire!
Fit for a cutthroat scallywag. Or me.
Does it make me look scurvy... I mean scary!?
Keeps me afloat without my boat!
An accident waiting to happen.
It's hot to the touch.
A winning combination!
This will leave a mark.
I'm a genius.
It's even bombier!
I can hear the wind trapped within.
There must be a scientific explanation for this.
The label says 'Keep out of reach of children'.
A trap for traps!
It's a tiny little hammer.
Critics panned it.
Science awaits!
Lusterless.
Plain fire. No science involved.
Both a house, and a home.

The Sterling Trough Deli- 
A place to eat.
A common store full of common goods.
I could use a fix-me-up.
There's fresh produce in there.
A garden variety shop.
A lot of strange things in there.
This could put a twinkle in my eye.
Instruments of destruction.
A place to hang your hat.
I can smell the history.
Ah. A useful place for a change.
For science-ing!
The local lawmaker.
I'm a Gentleman Politician now.
It says I can hire my own town guard.

Slanty Shanty BuildSlanty Shanty (owned)- 
Home sweet home.
It's surprisingly sturdy.
My new lab awaits!
Time to demonstrate some demolition.
Totally floored.
It's the floor.
A-floor-dable.
A stone cold floor.
A geometric ton of flooring.
Wipes the floor with the other flooring.
I 'wood' not say no to someone finishing this.
Totally floored.
Stone cold floor.
Totally floored.
Totally floored.
Geometric ton of flooring.
A place to put stuff.
Basic.
It could use some work.
Nice use for a ladder.
Functional.
This doesn't make sense.
A place to hang stuff.
A place to hang your hat.
It's a potted plant.
It's still a work in progress.
That's fancy.
A fancy way to hold a plant.
A fancy way to hold a fancy plant.
A holder for a fancy plant.
A fancy way to hold a boring plant.
A hanging plant.
A plant cage.
It's like a pet that grows!
Those look hungry.
It's a growing chandelier!
It's bent out of shape over something.
Is it that time of year already?
Stable enough.
Adds some stability.
Adds some fancy stability.
A bunch of wood.
A chunk of checkered stuff put on a wall.
Some fancy stuff put on a wall.
Pretty paper on a wall.
Pretty paper on a wall.
It's a wall.
It's a wall.
I'm 'knot' going to say anything bad about it.
Pretty paper on a wall.
'Marble'ous piece of wall.
It's a wall.
Kind of square.
Im-'plush'-onable.
Looks pretty sad.
Very functional.
A fancy hanging light.
It could use some decoration.
Two boring lights.
Fancy hanging light.
A fancy light.
Someone left their hat up there.
Who's that kid?
Now I can look at my gentlemanly figure.
How cozy.
Well that's nice.
I have an axe to grind with this.
In-spear-ed.
Science-y.
A little dramatic.
Science says it's bad for your health.
Is this bad luck, or good?
So that's where the smell is coming from.
He looks unhappy.
I could sit on that.
Someone could sit on that.
A couple people could sit on that.
A spiky seat.
Somewhere to rest my feet.
I don't trust it.
A comfy chair to sit on.
That chair is rocking!
Seat. Foot rest. The ottoman has many uses.
A chair to chaise after.
Builds a small domicile.
Builds a simple residence.
Builds a dwelling with some character.
Builds a brickwork residence.
Builds a reasonable shelter.
Builds a considerable home.
Builds a sizable habitation.
I wood like to see whats through there.
That door rocks.
I feel like it's watching me.
A door I can go through.
A door I can go through.
A door I can go through.
A little like being eaten.
I hope that bat is dead.
Lets in some sunlight.
Not exactly high class.
It's a window.
It's a window. A tall window.
Lets in some sunlight.
It's a window. That's tall.
A big window.
I feel like someone's watching me.
Kind of square.
It's a rug.
It covers a lot of ground.
A dead animal someone left on the floor.
I can step on you!
Did an animal step on this or is it just decoration?
Swirlish.
There's a dead animal on the floor.
Good for the lab.
Oh what a tangled web we weave...
I better test its metal.
Just a reproduction.
Is that my beard?
I think they nailed it.
Murderous.
Geometrical.
A fancy lamp.
A pretty lamp.
Two for the price of one.
An old fancy lamp.
Two for the price of one!
A little plain.
This one could use a lampshade.
A practical lamp.
It's a round table.
I could get some work done there.
Pretty basic.
Interesting decor...
I could put things on that.
Check and mate.
A blank map. Doesn't seem very useful.
You'd make a good lab assistant.
Pretty cute for a lil monster!
Much less mucusy than its momma.
It's wyrmed its way into my heart.
What an aerodynamical creature!
My feathered friend.
I keep her around because she's good at mothematics.
It makes me hungry just looking at it.
That was never really my thing.
I can relate.
It's even heavier than it looks.
It's a horse, of course.
It's a stone bishop.
The chess pieces are moving themselves!
Hmm...looks familiar.
That doesn't look so kingly to me.
I feel like its eye follows you.
It was a lot bigger up close.
Eurgh. It's so lifelike.
Ah, that brings back memories. Bad ones.
It looks nice, doesn't it?
It's as heavy as it looks.
I've been feeling pretty inspired lately.
I only worship science.
Stuff for science!
I've made it extra effective.
I'm not really cut out for fighting.
It's just textbook chemistry.
It would be nice to do some experiments on the water.
Manual ship acceleration.
Just in case of disaster.
Now I can build an anchor.
Now I can build a mast.
Spread my wings and sail away!
That's going to be the steering wheel.
The foreword just says 'Hope you like dragoons.'
No point studying when I can just wing it.
I see no farm in reading that.
Strange, it's just 500 pages of telegraph codes.
The beginning was dull, but got better near the end.
Someone'll get suckered into reading this.
Good for mending.
She's made a sort of automatic defense system.
It needs some electricity.
It's on fire!
Science couldn't save it.
What an ingenious idea!
Looks science-y. How does it work?
It's getting low on power.
I could get it working, if Winona's busy.
Hey! That's not science!
It'll turn off soon.
Science beats magic, every time.
The best offense is a good defense.
It'd really poke whoever stepped on it.
Wormwood offered me a bite, but I respectfully declined.
A powerfully potent powder.
Sweet! It's sweet!
A flagon of fiery fluid.
A little sodium's good for the heart.
It's some sort of delicious pocket dimension for sugary treats.
The cavities are probably worth it, right?
What corruption of science grew these?
My teeth are going to have something to say about this tomorrow.
Much better tasting than the real thing.
Only a sucker wouldn't love this.
They wriggle on the way down.
Sticks to your teeth.
It's... corn.
Everyone'll be raisin' a fuss over these.
I... don't think I'll be eating those.
Did that candy just move?
Oh, my poor jaw.
I don't do well with spice.
I don't believe in the supernatural.
I know someone who'd have a ball with this!
Hard to find a good flask around here.
I might need these after all that candy.
Let's make a wish. For science.
I hope this doesn't attract spiders.
I think it came from another world. One with grifts.
I wonder where the other one is?
Holding it makes me feel like bartering.
It's a little warm to the touch.
It's full of someone's childhood memories.
It's not very good at jumping.
It's some sort of plant specimen.
It's picking up frequencies from another world.
Maybe a tool for testing aerodynamics?
Sanity is a small price to pay for science!
Full of grit.
A potent potion.
I was hoping for something bigger.
Crystalized inferno.
Infused with transforming such-and-such.
Something's in there! I'll have to root it out.
It'll grow up big and horrifying.
Completely batty decoration.
Everyone's raven about tree decorations these days.
This wood look good hanging somewhere.
A spectornament I could hang in a tree.
Eight-armed adornment.
Almost i-tentacle to the real ones.
Did you see that?!
Those trees don't seem so spooky anymore.
That's a wrap!
Is that for me?
I need a pine cone for that.
That puts a damper on the festivities.
It's almost Winter's Feast!
Happy Winter's Feast!
That was a mistake, I think.
The anatomy's not right, but I'll overlook it.
That experiment may have been a tiny bit unethical.
I'm going to eat forty. For science.
A Yuletide toothache waiting to happen.
It's nice to eat something other than berries for once.
I'm puddin' that straight in my mouth!
It's a hollowed apple filled with yummy juice.
How does it stay warm? A thermodynamical mug?
Can science explain why it tastes so good?
Every scientist appreciates a good bauble.
A tree's not complete without some electricity.
This one is especially impressive.
I should hang this one over a fire.
For some reason it makes me hungry.
I feel like it wants something.
I've got to plant something there.
That won't do at all.
Is there something inside that?
What a lucky find!
Filled with explosion science!
This lantern feels more special than the others.
It's inordinately large.
So who gets to be the head?
I'm middling on this middle piece.
Someone has to bring up the rear.
I should make something fun.
I need to put a torch in it.
It burned down.
This'd stop a dog in its tracks.
It's been unleashed!
It looks so real.
A terror cotta monster!
Did it just move?
A picture of a sculpture. We'll need somewhere to make it.
And I didn't even get eaten!
That thing's the leashed of my worries.
More stuff to make.
It's hungry for meat.
Burnt out.
A feast fit for me.
A meal only a beast would love.
Nothing fancy.
This looks important.
Here's mud in your eye!
He's got gold fever!
Wouldn't you rather hit someone else?
What are you looking at?
It's too late for that now.
I need to clean up first.
It's too dangerous for that right now.
That's the guy in charge here.
I can take him!
This one's got bite.
Its shell is so spiky!
That spit is corrosive!
He's got a strong arm on him.
You sure are big!
He's got a nose for this kind of work.
I can smell him from here!
That's how we got here. Hopefully how we get back, too.
I'll just be going now.
It needs a key.
That should do it.
This is where those enemies are coming from.
Everyone, break the Battle Standard!
I guess they're fighting for us.
It's a rock monster!
It conducts regenerative energy.
It calls a meteor from above.
This'll keep those monsters held for a little while.
I can't make out the text.
It's a heavy hammer for hitting things.
I could do a quick charge with that.
It gets to the point.
That weapon's for throwing.
A sharp looking instrument.
That's a weapon I could use from range.
It uses a strong blast of air to propel a projectile.
It smells like brimstone.
Light, but not very durable.
Lightweight and designed for mobility.
It offers a decent amount of protection.
That could help me hit a little harder.
I'd have energy for a few more stunts wearing that.
That's as good as it gets.
This armor has been petrified for maximum protection.
That should keep me safe.
My strikes would hurt a little more wearing that.
It looks like it packs a wallop.
That could cause some major destruction.
Those fluffy feathers make me want to run!
Those crystals will quickened my abilities.
It has a gaze full of science.
Looks like it amplifies healing expertise.
The blossom interacts well with healing magic.
This garland will restore a bit of my vitality.
Let me help you.
Good as new!
Much better, thank-you.
I'm not skilled enough to use that.
Reminds me of my old nanny.
This goat's much smaller.
Maybe they'd be willing to trade.
I guess you're in charge around here?
It's sleeping, for now.
It's a super hairy pig.
Science says it should have died by now.
He's just winging it.
They're dead.
That rock's alive!
Those berries are all gone.
Probably chock full of vitamins.
Are those mushrooms? I'm stumped.
I don't think it's growing back.
I don't think the altar will want that.
I can't get anything else out of that.
It reminds me of those tentacle monsters.
I can't get anymore out of that shrub.
It's full of delicious, delicious sap.
Where'd the tree go? I'm stumped.
Here sappy, sappy, sap.
Sweet golden sap.
That's how you get ants.
It looks ill.
Kind of clingy.
We'd better start cooking some offerings.
It's in the process of digestinating.
Another dead end.
It's an old statue.
What are you looking at?
On the road to nowhere.
Preyed upon.
Something put a damper on that chimney.
That clock's been punched.
No longer a-door-able.
Someone hit the roof.
Take that, creature!
So lifelike.
It's seen better days.
Some pig's house was ruined.
The scientific term is: 'Sharp pointy thing'.
Locked tight.
Turns out a key was the key to getting in.
The daily grind.
Been a long time since it was hooked up to water.
As far as posts go, this one is adequate.
A monumental monument.
What an ugly little house.
It's a safe. For keeping things safe.
It won't open without the key.
Any science in there?
I could use some stuff.
A little salty spring.
Huh. Reminds me of home.
Enlightening.
Someone beat the clock. Literally.
Ashes to ashes.
Must have mis-spoke.
Kitchen stuff.
For suspension-based cookery.
It has hang-ups.
For scientifically burning things.
It needs ingredients to make the science work.
For grilling small meats.
Barbecurious.
I'll have to grill someone about this.
Now all I need is a backyard to put it in.
Let's get cooking!
This one holds more ingredients.
For making minuscule motleys.
A dish for all seasonings.
I need to sweeten this pot.
For harvesting salt from the pond.
Science takes time.
Salt has gathered on the rope.
A crabby trap.
It's a farming instrument.
Laboratory tools for surgical butchery.
We can use it to gather sap from the trees.
Safe bet this'll come in handy.
I'll park it in my pocket until I get to the park.
This looks science-y.
Sow what?
A handful of odd seeds.
Mm, fresh fish.
Ready for the dinner table.
No imitations here.
I can put a meal together in a pinch.
We cooked the foliage.
These are edible mushrooms.

GarlicGarlic- 
The number one breath enhancer.
Perfectly browned.
Looks crunchy.
A successful chemical reaction.
The apples of the earth.
A successful temperature experiment.
It's red because it's full of science.
Cooking's easy if you understand chemistry.
It's a raw turnip.
Cooking is science in practice.
It looks a bit grainy.
Ready for baking.
Good if you don't think about where it came from.
Salt. The tastiest mineral.
It's full of salt.
It tastes sweet.
Might as well toss it on the fire.
Adds sweetness to the mixture.
I could grind it up to make a spice.
Flavorful.
I'd like more than a penny for my thoughts.
A decent amount of coin.
Seems valuable.
We can use these to reopen the Gateway.
I should offer it on the Altar of Gnaw.
That's not what it wants.
Science says this will appease the sky God.
It's more of a light snack, really.
That one was an experiment.
A silver plated plate.
A bright bowl.
The gate is locked.
I only need to use one dish.
It needs another type of dish.
There's already a meal there.
It won't want to eat that.
I'll just have to find another key.
Science says I have to wait my turn.
Those ingredients didn't make anything.
I left it on too long.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Time to go!
It's all piney.
This sad tree has no cones.
Those spikes look sharp!
Take that, nature!
Not so spiky now!
What a waste of wood.
Spikes and fire!
I feel like I could have prevented that.
Now it's burnt and spiky.
It'll be a tree soon!
It's big, it's heavy, and it's wood.
That's some hot wood!
It's small, dark and smells like burnt wood.
I can hear a tiny tree inside it, trying to get out.
I don't think an axe will cut it.
Is it watching me?
It looks worried.
Baby trees are so cute!
That'll teach him.
That's burning fast!
It's a bunch of small twigs.
It's a tuft of grass.
I cut it down in the prime of its life.
It needs poop.
It's burning fast!
Cut grass, ready for arts and crafts.
Red berries taste the best.
Maybe they'll grow back?
I think it needs to be fertilized.
I should plant this.
It's a clump of reeds.
I picked all the useful reeds.
That's really burning!
Cut reeds, ready for crafting and hobbying.
Leafy!
Guh! It's growing so slowly!
Mmmm. Ready to harvest.
It's a plant.
It looks thorny.
Ouch.
That's burning fast!
It's pretty but it smells like a common laborer.
I showed those flowers who's boss!
Augh! It's so evil!
I'm not sure I want to hold these.
The earth is making plantbabies.
It's a mushroom.
It's sleeping.
I wonder if it will come back?
It's all leafy. Most of the time.
Take that, nature!
What a waste of wood.
I feel like I could have prevented that.
There's definitely something inside there.
It'll be a tree soon!
It might be okay if it cooled down.
It's not going to grow back while it's so hot.
Nothing will grow in this heat.
The heat killed it.
Sharp but delicious.
Deflated, but still spiny.
Who knows what that tumbleweed has picked up.
Looks pretty sturdy.
Bye bye, bamboo.
I feel like I could have prevented that.
That tree needs a hair cut.
What a waste of wood.
It's all viney!
Whoops.
Take that, nature!
I need to plant this.
I suppose I should pick it up.
It will grow into a nice jungle tree.
I can hear the hissing of tiny snakes.
Maybe I can bamboozle my enemies with this?
Maybe I can tie stuff up with this.
I hope you're thirsty, grass.
I wonder what it's plotting...
Is that what passes for food around here?
I wonder if it's getting enough water?
I wonder how that happened.
How tropical.
It doesn't need my help to grow anymore.
I'm fond of these fronds.
Just like any other tree.
Look. A plant.
I'm in-tree-ged.

It smells vaguely tolerable.

Asparagus plantedAsparagus (planted)- 

Radish plantedRadish (planted)- 

Nettle VineNettle Vine- 
This plant's strong odor clears my sinuses.
I'm sure it will grow back.
It really doesn't like this dirt.
It looks all watered and happy.
Science says this needs dirt, fast!
An overly complicated spiky thing.
It's pretty, but is it worth the trouble?
Always hanging around.
It totally blocks out the sun.
The science is blooming well this season.

Lily PadLily Pad- 
It's full of science. I can tell.
A bit of ornamentation.
It's been neatly kept.
It looks like it could use a shave.
It's burning.
Glad that's over with.
To think the artist had only hoofs to work with.
Sure likes looking at itself.
Something big moved that there.
Looks bushed.
A sticky situation.
Science says it's a tree.
What could've broken that?
This needs to be planted.
It was cut down in the prime of its life.
It can be planted anywhere now.
I think those are the edible kind.
It's very much on fire.
Now it can be taken anywhere.
All the useful reeds have already been picked.
Sure showed those flowers who's boss!
I'm not sure I want to hold those.
How did this tree even reproduce?
It's all burnt up.
It's all sticky.
Take that, nature!
What a waste of wood.
I feel like I could have prevented that.
That tree looks pretty wimpy.
It doesn't need any help to grow.
There's a sticky tree inside it that wants to get out.
Err, something's not right.
It looks pretty sick.
I should leave them there until it's time to eat.
The bush is working hard on the next batch.
It won't make any berries in this state.
This could be replanted closer to home.
The heat even dehydrated the juicy berries!
It looks carved.
Makes sense to me.
To match my rosy cheeks.
Aloe there.
I could eat that, but I'd rather not.
Welp. It's kelp.
I just couldn't kelp myself.
I can plant it in deep water.
A dead tree that washed up on shore.
There might still be something worth digging up.
That driftwood's burning!
Doesn't look very useful anymore.
It floats on water.
I didn't know trees grew on the moon.
That was a pretty thick tree.
The tree is burning!
The tree burnt down.
It fell from the moon tree.
A moth turned into a tree? Lunacy!
It's a bush... From the moon!
It'll take a while to grow more fruit.
Its fruit growing days are over.
It's pretty hot out.
Err, something's not right.
It looks pretty sick.
It's burning!
It's growing.
It's buzzing with activity.
I think those bees are mad.
Bees used to live in this.
I've got no bones to pick with the owner. Really.
Creepy.
What an odd looking stone.
That's a CRAZY looking rock!
Where did the rest of it go?
TAKE THAT, SANE SELF!
It's more of a pyramid than an obelisk.
What has happened to the head?
I think I could use that.
Fancy!
Who would live here?
The stinkiest thing I'll smell all day.
Looks like an offering to the beast.
Sure looks cozy.
That's too strong to break through!
It wouldn't fit in my pocket.
I can make stuff with these.
It's a very sharp rock.
I'm not a geologist.
I can't eat it, but it sure is shiny.
I bet there's all sorts of good stuff down there!
I should probably feel bad about that.
It's a pile of dirt... or IS it?
Tracks left by food. I mean... an animal.
The beast's trail ends here.
This track is fresh, the beast must be nearby.
This appears to be the nexus to another world!
Soon my invention will be complete!
There's still something missing.
With this I can surely pass through space and time!
A ring that could focus dimensional energies.
Tough enough to handle the most intense experiments.
This thing may control the polarity of the whole universe.
This metal contains great and feared power.
Soft and undulating.
Science compels me to jump in.
That was not a sane thing to do.
I can't see the bottom!
Better you than me.
Sticky!
I hope these don't hatch in my pocket.
That must lead to the Kingdom of the Bunnymen.
It looks warm and cozy inside.
Looks like somebody was camping here.
That fellow looks like he wants to talk.
This is why I hate the water.
If only I had some way of hooking on to it from here.
Ice to meet you.
A very isolated glacier.
Nothing useful until it freezes again.
The wet ground won't hold a footprint.
What a nice hole in the ground for a home!
The Kingdom of the Bunnymen is closed for the season.
Nothing to live in, now.
Burnt merm flesh somehow smells even worse.
Crispy.
It's a den in a stump.
Its owner ran out of lives.
I'm not sure what that's supposed to be.
I broke it. For science.
Better him than... wait a minute!
It's even less seaworthy than before.
They call a dug hole in the sand their home.
Doesn't smell very good.
Who would live here?
Nothing to live in, now.
This area seems pretty fishy.
That Wascal is sleeping.
The coral have formed a reef!
Living building material!
That's a baby coral reef.
I could fill a pail with all those snails.
I can't fill a pail without snails.
I can dig it.
I see a golden opportunity.
Maybe I should stand back.
It looks like a premier steamer trunk.
You better stay out of my shoes.
A handy pile of pocket sand.
Is that sand pile purring?
That is a rather large pile of sand.
My scientific know-how tells me that's a perfectly safe mountain!
Do I hear cracking?
Something down there has bad breath.
I wonder where it went...
The water is too rough!
Follow those bubbles!
There must be a way to get that tar out.
Do I have to hold it with my bare hands?
Who's cleaning that up, I wonder?
A pool left by the tides.
A bit hot for my tastes.
I wonder if they are from Brussels.
I really stuck it to them.
I suppose I could linger for a moment or two...
Gives me an uneasy feeling.
I hope that thing is water proof.
Part of a wrecked ship.
There must be a way to open it.
It smells as bad as it looks.
Sea refuse.
Maybe I could sell these.
I think I'll stay away from that.
How original.
Please be a good treasure!
It's my buddy!
Sure, I could fish it out of there. But should I?
Poor little boat.
I think it's missing some parts.
Wonder what this is used for.
Looks like a part of something.
Seems like it was made with a purpose in mind.
Looks like I could use this.
You never know what you'll find under a rock.
It's a pile of dung.
Most definitely poop.
An electrifying discovery!
I'm heading out of here!
Careful, it's armed!
All that iron should be mine.
Not a leg to stand on.
Isn't it ironic?
Pool's gold.
Aw... it's hardly worth anything.
Science says it's gnad good.
It's a peaceful life.

Farm HouseQuarry Lodgings- 
I have no quarry with them.

Secret Bandit CampSecret Bandit Camp- 
Treasure!
A den of bloodsuckers.
Looks like an adventure to be had.
It looks... screamy.
This must be where those giant bugs live.
A few sticks or logs will brighten this up.
Looks like a headache.
It's an old wall.
I prefer fountains of knowledge.
Well that looks ominous.
Defying the laws of science.
That bursts my balloon.
A complete basket case.
I'll just leave that here.
I don't want to lug that luggage around.
I guess it raised some red flags.
It's been sandbagged.
Eggshell-ent
What eggsactly is that?
That makes me egg-stremely nervous.
Egg-sploded.
Busted and rusted.
Anyone home?
It's always a good idea to touch base.
We could make stuff with these.
He probably deserved it.
Soon, the invention will be complete!
I hope these don't hatch. Period.
This ought to be a scientific impossibility.
How in science did it get so big?!
It's too sticky to walk on.
Was that there before?
It's some sort of marble statue.
It looks old, but it feels new.
It's an odd marble statue.
It's not in the best shape.
There's a big piece missing.
I guess he cracked under the pressure.
All patched up.
Now what?
At least it's back in one piece now.
Something's moving inside.
Magmificent!
As gneiss a place as any.
Spooky.
Statuesque.
Don't lose your head now!
It's a fancy marble statue.
That rock came from the moon.
There's science inside!
I'm sure there's some scientific explanation for this.
It's all smashed up.
There's a hole in the middle for something to go in.
Now what?
The stone lit it up somehow.
I have a distinct feeling this isn't right.
I could probably break that.
It looks scared stiff.
Is there something in there?
%s must've died performing an experiment with %s.
Something's odd here, but I can't put my finger on it.
Just keep your hand to yourself, alright?
Where did this come from?
Where's the rest of it?
Is that a head?
It looks very lifelike.
I don't like how it's looking at me.
We should definitely open that.
Is that a mirage?
It's dry as a bone.
I think I can lift this one.
It's out of reach.
Aw, what a cute little starfish!
It tried to chomp me!
It's not fooling anyone now.
Hm? What did you say?
It wants to be finished.
It doesn't want to be on the ground.
I feel compelled to carry it somewhere.
It wants me to give it a home.
My brain pulses with peace and terror.
The cracks in this place are starting to show.
If only I could soak my weary bones.
Just a simple chemical reaction.
Water turns to glass under the moon. That's just science.
I'll just have to wait for it to fill up again.
There's something trapped inside.
I can practically see my reflection in it.
It's very sharp.
That's what they get for coming up on land.
It's a rock.
That's not a normal spider den.
Are those natural formations?
I guess it just grows like that.
It's mined... it's all mined!
Science compels me to lick it.
I made a compromise with wilderness.
I wonder if I could move that rock.
The earth itself rejects me!
I bet there's all sorts of things to discover down there.
I'll just stay down here, I suppose.
I've had enough discovery for now.
These used to grow in my bathroom.
A magic mushroom?
That mushroom got too big for its own good.
Science makes it glow.
It's strangely tasty looking.
Looks like a rock to me.
Rocks, rocks, rocks, rocks...
It's encrusted with old webbing.
A den of 'ew'.
Did that just move?
It's a fern.
Some leafy greens.
It's dubiously photosynthetical.
Not my fault!
Smells like a million giant bats.
It's holding up the roof.
I'll have to wait until someone leaves to enter.
The surface is too crowded!
I don't want to wake them.
I'm mildly offended by this.
It's trying to reproduce.
You can't tell from far away, but it's quite smelly.
The spiders thought this one was important.
Hasn't a care in the world.
That's a sight for spore eyes.
It's just drifting around.
I'll keep a little light in my pocket.
I don't think it got enough sun.
Seems safe to me.
Science bones! We should put them back together.
Still missing some pieces.
My scientific instincts say this isn't quite right.
It's alive! Oh wait, no, it's not.
It's not put together right.
It won't resurrect.
I wonder if I could move that rock.
I bet there's all sorts of things to discover down there.
It seems to throb out of tune with the world.
This seems to be broken.
An ancient and mysterious structure.
Some algae by a pond.
A pile of broken chess pieces.
Another pile of broken chess pieces.
Even more broken chess pieces.
Ancient household goods.
Nothing to work with here.
It's some smaller chunks of Thulecite.
Only a cyanobacteria could grow in this light.
It may contain something fantastic! Or horrible.
It may contain a bigger something fantastic! Or horrible.
I wonder what function this served.
I hear whispers. It wants something.
It's passing its judgment.
It didn't like that.
I guess I'm worthy.
The essential components are still intact.
It's gaining power.
Back in working order.
The gateway is destabilizing.
It needs time to recover. Me too.
I don't recognize any of these symbols.
Something must power it.
A truly unsettling light.
It depicts an old civilization. The people look hungry and scared.
This tablet is too worn to make out.
Something dark creeps over the city and its people.
The people are shedding their skins. They look different underneath.
It shows a massive, technologically advanced city.
It doesn't seem fully real.
I feel inspired.
This is a plant I could learn to love.
Maybe they'll grow back?
I think it needs to be fertilized.
Looks malnourished.
This belongs in the ground!
That cactus seems abnormally pokey.
Yikes! I could poke my eye out!
It'll sprout more pokers again some day.
A portable poker plant.
I'm glad I didn't step on this.
Blast it! It won't be mined!
It's a fire rock.
Would need an awfully big stocking...
You look ashen.
It's SPITacularly disgusting!
That seems like an excessive amount of locks.

Volcano AltarVolcano Altar of Snackrifice- 
It appears to be closed.
The altar is open and ready to accept offerings!
I can feel a cool breeze outside.
That pot looks smashing!
I wish it wasn't quite so striking.
I wonder what wonders hide in there?
Take that booby traps!
These ruins have been ruined.
I could probably sell that to one of those pigs.
It's holding up the roof.
Creepy creepers.
A few sticks or logs will brighten this up.
What are the probabilities of this working?
I should offer it something.
Looks scientifically apocalyptic.
Looks like it houses insects.
Takes its sweet time making honey.
Provides some light in an otherwise dark existence.
Don't hatch. Don't hatch. Don't hatch...
I should break that. For science.
Majestic.
Fancy enough to be behind glass.
I wouldn't want my boat to float away.
Not much left of it.
I should patch that up before we sink.
Avast! A mast!
Couldn't we have just made a lifeboat?
I could have been a sailor in another life.
These are floorboards.
It's surprisingly scratchy.
These are pretty snazzy.
Hastily cobbled stones.
Fungal red floor.
Green fungus-y turf.
A chunk of ground.
Yet another ground type.
Yet another ground type.
Dirty turf.
Sssstyle ssssstatement.
Very gnarled ground.
Meadow-y turf.
Lava-y floor.
Marsh-y floor.
Ashy turf.
Volcano-y turf.
It's a chunk of ground.
Some nicely cobbled together rocks.
You want proof it's fireproof?
A chunk of moon ground.
A chunk of beach.
Check it out!
Back off, preacherman!
Storm the castle!
It's a knightmare!
It's falling apart!
Terrifying!
What was that?!
OW! Something bit me!
You ain't nothing, hound dog!
That one is glowy.
Are there hounds for every season?
It's sharp!
I hate spiders.
Looks even meaner than usual.
I'd better not be here when he wakes up.
I should keep my distance.
Ewwww!
Good riddance!
It has a tangy, antiseptic smell.
It comes from a spider's butt.
He's going after my stuff!
Ew. It has Krampus slime all over it.
Smells fishy!
He's so cute!
Aww, look at him sleep!
He's croaked it.
That looks dangerous.
It's pointy and slimy.
I think these were its genitalia.
A slimy pole.
Yet another slimy pole.
Seems stinky, but worth exploring.
Little slippery arms.
He doesn't look as friendly as the others.
He's not friendly!
This offends me as a scientist.
Walruses are natural predators.
He won't be cute and cuddly forever.
I'm sure I'll find a use for it eventually.
It's covered with walrus hairs.
Disgusting little bloodsucker.
Hey, is that my blood?
It's probably not someone else's blood...
Aaah! Bug off!
Gah! More spiders!
I hate spiders!
Ack! That's terrifying!
It's so alluring.
Now I can start my very own meat farm.
I think I'm being watched.
It's so hairy!
Doesn't look much different dead.
Note to self: Don't look up.
It's a worm!
Seems safe to me.
Just looks like a pile of dirt.
What a crusty looking animal.
Scratchy metal fibers.
You might be something to reckon with, big dog.
It looks unhappy about me stealing those Birchnuts!
Take that, nature!
A mad little nut.
I'd rather stay away from the business end of that jerk.
That looks like an experiment gone wrong.
It's a dog-eat-me world out here.
Get off the water you maniac!
Leave me alone!
Eye see.
He met a terrible end. I will too if I don't get out of here.
These blasted mosquitoes carry a terrible sickness.
Part of a yellow mosquito.
I wonder if it'll sell me some oil?
Even worse than a common snake!
I'm intrigued AND repelled.
Looks even meaner than usual.
I should keep my distance.
Good riddance!
These things sure are persistent.
I think I'll keep my distance.
I think this fish evolved to run me through.
Looks like a fighter.
I think bloating has begun...
You're a quick one, aren't you?
Scientifically impossible.
I'm not going anywhere near that!
Better gnat go near those guys.
Always hanging around.
I don't like the look of him.
Swindling swine.
A shadowy chapeau.
A map to where that thief hid all his treasure!
A pernicious amphibian.
Looks deranged.
That better not be poisonous.
Plants shouldn't move! That's just science!
Science could not have done this.
That thing is rather large!
I don't want to wake it.
That's that.
I'd prefer to keep all of my blood.
Hopefully it won't get up again.
I feel a bit safer.
Is the bat hide hiding in there?
Agh! Stay away!
Whee!
I'll be careful with this carapace.
That presence... it's familiar! Hello?
Looks serious.
It's probably someone else's blood...
It's being controlled by that beast!
It's guarding the queen.
Too hot to handle.
The smell is not the most pleasant.
I think we're safe now.
Science save us!
Science save us!
I have a very strong desire to run.
Now I can breathe easy.
That thing's terrifying!
Thank goodness. It's sleeping.
That's the end of that.
Oh good. The moon mutated it.
Thank science, it stopped moving.
Is it really dead?
It's a beefalo!
He's coming along peacefully.
These guys are really heavy sleepers.
Aww, he's so sad.
This one is slightly less smelly than the others.
Hmmm, there may be too much food inside it.
This fellow appears quite ridable.
It looks deeply angry.
It smells like beefalo tears.
It sounds like a beefalo field in there.
Awwww. So cute!
He's watching me.
To bee or not to bee.
Oh no! It's a killer bee!
Careful!
This seems dangerous.
Looks sharp!
They kind of creep me out.
He's part of my entourage.
Someone should tell his family.
It still has the tail on it.
I am filled with an irresistible urge to do science.
I just like holding it.
Adorably delicious.
It looks warm and full of meat.
Must be breeding season.
It has terrifying claws.
Ew. Just ew.
He's less gross, but still gross.
If it wasn't useful, I wouldn't touch it.
A puzzle with no solution.
I hope it doesn't mess up my hair.
It sticks to my back.
Curious little guy.
What a bizarre buzzard!
A playful little thing.
I think it's still swishing.
'Baaaah' yourself!
I don't think it liked being struck by lightning.
It's like a miniature lightning rod.
This whale has emotional issues.
Gross. I think the bloating has begun.
Such a round, rubbery fellow.
Guess that house is FINished.
Science works in mysterious, blobby ways.
Now this creature is pure science!
These creatures seem reasonable.
I grabbed the ox by the horn.
Those things are going to be the end of me.
Looks aggressive.
Large and screamy.
Large and pointy-headed.
This ought to be of some use.
What a huge bug!
An bug at rest will stay at rest.
Exterminated.
A spinny spiny sort.
It's boring.
Science says it's always hungry.
Please don't arrest me.
Sweet dreams, smelly.
You're part of my entourage.
Someone should tell its family.
I feel a lil better when I hold one.
That would mess up my hair.
It sticks to your back when you wear it.
It's cute, but it's not ripe yet.
I think it's ripe now.
It's snoozing.
Butterfly, flutter by.
Now I have you!
Creepy!
He's not very happy in there.
Does that mean spring is coming?
He likes my pocket.
Life in the frozen wastes.
It's so soft.
A crow feather.
A redbird feather.
A snowbird feather.
Stupid bird! Stay away from my berries!
It's looking at me.
It went to sleep.
The eyebone was consumed by fire when I teleported!
Otto von Chesterfield, Esq.
He's looking for carrots.
Do you like science?
If only I could catch them!
They make my pocket glow!
I've heard strange things about those plants.
Stop following me!
Mandrake roots have strange properties.
Poor little guy.
Ugh, my head!
Does that mean winter is gone?
It's cute, in a gross kind of way.
The petals shimmer in the light.
The petals droop and shimmer in the light.
The flower was consumed by fire when I teleported!
These would look awesome on a helmet!
This goop smells foul.
Something's under there, searching for minerals.
I'd sure like to whack that mole... thing.
Nowhere left to dig, my friend.
These make a soothing glow.
Don't get snappy with me, mister.
I wonder where that crabbit went?
It has that wet-dog smell.
You have got to be kitten me.
Looks like something I want to carry around.
All that's left after the fire has done its job.
I bet I could pack'im full of stuff.
A colorful blob of science.
That's a lot of tendrils.
I find myself fresh out of crackers.
I try not to eat anything with a name.
Shoo! Find some other land!
Shoo! Find some other water!
I tou-can't catch him.
I bet it eats a lot of fish.
I feel oddly protective of this dumb bird.
It's for doydoy eggs, dummy.
Soft AND endangered!
Maybe I should have let it hatch.
Oh well. I'm sure there are lots more!
A controlled chemical reaction has made this egg matter more nutritious.
What a cute little... thing.

Teen DoydoyTeen Doydoy (held)- 

WobsterWobster- 
What a Wascally Wobster.
You better not try anything fishy.

I hope he doesn't farm pigs.
Dreaming of manure.

Garden variety villager.
Wouldn't she prefer a flower bed?

A tip of the hat to anyone able to sleep so soundly.

Do you have killing implements available here?
Killing time.

Mr. Fix-it.
Taking a rest.

What a pointy bill!
In a slumber.
Perished.
An azure bird.
It's just resting.
An ex-parrot.
It's only carrying a couple diseases.
It's fast asleep.
It has passed.
She's on a roll.
She needs to get her dung together.
She's pooped.
Dung for.
A light aflight.
You're not getting my gold.
That bush is alive!
Look! An iris bush.
It's getting some shut-eye.
Dead-eyed.
Still blinking.
He's a bit of a nut job.
Probably dreaming of trees.
I feel kinda bad.
For some reason I'm craving tea.
A shocking sight!
My current favorite.
Stupid bird! Stay away from those berries!
The eyebone was consumed by fire in the teleportation!
Cut it out!
It doesn't seem so strange anymore.
The flower was consumed by fire in the teleportation!
These would look empirically amazing on a helmet!
It's an extra leafy lizard.
I always wanted one of these.
Maybe he needs some science?
Hutch Danglefish, P.I.
Some sort of yellow creature made of science.
I'm not squishing you, am I?
It's probably fine.
A canary feather.
Aww. Who's a good monster?
It seems happy.
I hear a tiny stomach grumbling.
Poor thing must be starving.
There's a faint warmth coming from inside.
I never thought I would see a happy egg.
I don't think that egg is warm enough.
It's an egg tooth!
Cooled off and chilled out.
Is it staring at me? ...No, I guess not.
What an impressive antler!
Was that supposed to come off?
I've never seen a live puffin before!
Catching one ain't puffin to brag about.
Peacefully huffin' and puffin'.
Are carrots supposed to have legs?
You're kind of ugly up close.
It's almost cute.
That's the end of that.
My vast scientific knowledge tells me... It's a moon butterfly.
I've got you now.
That's a tall bird!
That's quite an egg.
The nest is empty.
Will it hatch?
Delicious and nutritional.
Looks like it's hatching.
Mmm. Beaky.
Are eggs supposed to sweat?
Brrrr!
I have a feeling this is going to take a while...
It should hatch any time now.
That's a rather small bird.
It looks hungry.
It must be starving.
Not a very tall bird.
I'd better find it some food.
It has a dangerous look in its eye.
Ow! Quit it!
That's quite an egg!
Is it shivering or am I?
You need some food and quick, huh?
He's huge!
AHHHHHHHH! That spider is huge!
I hope I got all of the spider goo out of it.
It's enormous!!
This is really gross.
That thing doesn't look happy.
Wow! I'm glad that didn't gore me!
What a bear of a badger.
A mat of thick fur.
I don't exactly know what that thing is.
Its contents are like excited electrons trying to escape.
Aaah! You are definitely not an electron!
Fluffy!
That's one fly dragon!
They're still warm.
Hot spit!
I like to call it 'Basaliva'.
Someone gimme a hand with this palm!
Now's not the time for me to be Quacken wise!
A beast that never sleeps.
To the victor, the spoils.
I'd say I made the pecking order around here quite clear.
I thought it was oddly windy around here.

SealSealnado (seal form)- 
D'awww.
Perhaps this powered the fury of that beastly storm?
This is a powerful artifact.
Well that's terrifying.
More eyes means better sight... right?
I wish I had gills.
Scientifically speaking, it shouldn't exist.
Ha ha, snake. I have your bone.
Petrifying.
A numbskull.
The Queen regn-ant.
Don't mess up my hair, crown.
Metaphisical end-ity.
I hope he doesn't want this back.
I regret causing that.
Metal touched with science.
It puts its babies there.
Keep that stinger away from me!
The world seems less a little crazy when I wear it.
What on earth is that thing!
Its chains came off!
It's really fancy for a deer antler.
That toadstool's just asking to be cut down.
Just a hole in the ground.
There's something poking out.
Yeesh! I'm not kissing that!
He's hopping mad now!
How scientific!
A mushroom cloud in the making!
Warts and all!
The skeleton fused with the shadows!
Sharp! Sharp bones!!
It's shielded!
Anklebiters!
No bones about it.
It gives me terrible visions.
It smells like chemicals.
It's been thuribly depleted.
I hate that guy.
Ewwww, he smells!
Maxwell's statues are trapping him.
Awww, she has a cute little bow.
That is one biiig foot.
He looks kind of regal.
I'm a sucker for this guy.
I already don't like that guy.
Three heads are better than one.
A leg up.
The tail end.
It wants something from me.
I think we're on good terms.
It looks mad.
A mini departiculator.
A more sane person would walk.
I could've been skewered!
It's so gritty!
Memories of the time I wasn't skewered.
That's science for you.
They're promising me... knowledge.
Stars and atoms! Are you my doppelgänger, %s?
Yeesh. Do I always look that creepy?
Your existence is an affront to the laws of science, %s!
%s has expertly put our theories into practice.
Better concoct a revival device. Can't leave another man of science floating.
Burning that wasn't very scientific, %s.
Good day to you, %s!
%s is holding that lighter pretty tightly...
Murderer! Arsonist!
%s, friend of ghosts.
I bet you're just burning for a heart, %s.
Again?
It's good to see you, %s!
Let's not start a fight with the strongman...
Murderer! I can take you!
%s is just a big teddy bear.
I told you you couldn't deadlift that boulder, %s. The numbers were all wrong.
You can't actually 'fight' fire, %s!
Greetings, %s!
%s doesn't have any sharp objects, does she?
Murderer!
%s treats ghosts like family.
I'm seeing double! I'd better concoct a heart for %s.
I know you set those flames, %s.
Good day to you, %s!
I think we need to tweak your primary directive, %s...
%s! You've violated the first law!
I guess %s got that empathy module up and running.
I always thought %s could use a heart. Now I'm certain!
You look like you're gonna melt, %s. What happened?
Good day, %s!
I think %s's planning to throw the book at me.
Here comes my peer review!
I have deep respect for %s's practical theorems.
This doesn't seem very scientific, does it, %s?
I'm sure you had a very clever reason for that fire.
Greetings, %s!
%s has been a bit of a sap lately...
Murder! Bring me an axe and we'll get in the swing of things!
%s saved everyone's backbacon.
Does 'universal' coverage include the void, %s?
%s's gone on a wood chucking rampage!
Will you bea-very mad if I don't revive you, %s?
Gad-zooks, that's a moose!
That moose'nt be very comfortable.
Take a gander at that!
Be more careful, you silly goose!
Don't burn yourself out, %s.
Greetings, %s!
%s is silent, but deadly...
Mime this!
%s thinks outside the invisible box.
How do you say 'I'll conduct a revival device' in mime?
Wait, don't tell me. You lit a fire.
Decent day to you, %s!
Seems you've gone from 'dapper' to 'slapper'.
I'll show you Logic and Reason... those're my fists!
%s is using his powers for good.
Don't look at me like that, %s! I'm working on it!
%s's just asking to get roasted.
Good day, %s!
I'd like to avoid a punch from %s, if possible.
%s's gone berserk!
%s has full command of spirits.
Nice try. You're not escaping to Valhalla yet, %s.
%s is really heating things up today.
Good day, %s!
I'm gonna roll up a piece of papyrus newspaper, just in case.
Murderer! I'll squash you, %s!
%s is playing well with others.
%s is really buggin' me for a heart.
We need to have a group meeting about fire safety.
Good day to you, %s!
%s is a safety hazard.
It ends here, %s!
It's pretty handy having you around, %s.
That probably threw a wrench into her plans.
Things are burning up at the factory today.
Greetings to you, %s!
I knew %s couldn't be trusted!
Time to grab the imp by the horns!
Thanks for lending a helping claw, %s.
I reject the reality of ghosts and imps.
%s is becoming a survival liability.
Greetings, %s!
%s seems pricklier than usual today.
Prepare to get weed whacked, %s!
%s never gives up on his friends.
You need some help, lil guy?
I thought you hated fire, %s.
Greetings, %s!
Well, this is a recipe for disaster.
I hope you don't have any half-baked plans to murder me!
Always rely on %s to cook up a plan.
Maybe he was cooking with ghost peppers.
He's gonna flambé the place right down!
Good day, %s!
%s is looking especially monstrous today...
You're just another murderous merm!
Why thank you, %s!
%s is looking greener around the gills than usual.
Didn't anyone teach you not to play with fire?!
Greetings, %s!
%s looks shifty...
Murderer!
%s, friend of ghosts.
%s could use a heart.
Burning that wasn't very scientific, %s.
A small, normal egg.
Sunny side yum!
It's a bit gamey, but it'll do.
Char broiled to perfection.
Just jerky enough.
A tiny chunk of dead animal.
Now I don't have to worry about getting worms!
A little jerky.
Ugh. I don't think I should eat that.
That's only somewhat more appetizing than when it was raw.
Strange-smelling jerky.
That doesn't look very appealing.
At least it's warm now.
I should gobble it.
Now it's even tastier.
Now I shall eat for a day.
Grilled to perfection.
This will make a delicious meal.
Smells great!
A light breezy trunk.
A thick, hairy trunk.
Somehow even more nasal than before.
I've heard it's a delicacy.
Tastes like chicken.
I hate these things, even when they're dead.
At least it's not coming back.
Good dog.
I better not run with this.
What a tropical looking fish.
It lived a good life. Maybe.
It's all wriggly.
An electric shock will not revive it. I tried.
A colorful snack!
I'd be a jerk not to eat this.
A chunk of fish meat.
Where did this can come from?
Grilled to perfection.
A small bit of fish.
A small bit of cooked fish.
Limpets Bizkets.
Escargotcha!
Could use some flexing.
I cook a mean mussel.
Fish babies.
Roe, sunny side up.
It looks like a fish, but it feels clammy.
Fried fry.
This one's extra water repellent.
Gilled to perfection.
Surf and turf, hold the turf.
That fish is fin-ished.
A sleek fin.
You should cook up nicely.
I can't wait to eat you.
I'm not dissecting that.
Where the dragoon once stored its feelings.
Looks noxious.
Tainted fricassee.
Small and gelatinous.
I have to be pretty desperate for food.
Now there's no reason to worry about getting worms!
Ready for gobbling.
Even better for gobbling!
I hate those things, even when they're dead.
Looks like the runt of its school.
I won't win any bragging rights with this one.
It's a bit on the small side.
A fish this size won't tide me over for long.
I can't wait to pop it in my mouth.
I certainly hope it tastes better than it looks.
I went to a lot of treble to catch it.
I wasn't lion about my aptitude for fishing!
I'm sure this won't bring me any bad luck.
This one seems kind of corny.
Red berries taste the best.
I don't think heat improved them.
It's mushy.
Yum!
What a weird fruit.
Still weird.
Oh, it smells!
Now it smells even worse!
It looks like the inside of an alien's brain.
Haute Cuisine!
Sticky sweet.
Juicy and warm.
It's mushy.
Yum!
It requires a large nut hacker.
When I click them together, they make horsey sounds!
Now I just need a cake.
They could use some roasting.
Heat definitely improved them.
The fruit's still weird.
Extra tasty, though they won't last long.
Better eat them before they spoil!
Yuck. It's all vegetabley.
Mushy.
High in fructose!
It doesn't look like an egg.
It's even less eggy.
It's as big as my head!
How did it not turn into a pie?
It smells funny.
It seems pretty normal.
It's weird and gooey.
It's different now...
Looks delicious.
Nutritious, but it won't last long.
There are still some spines between me and a tasty meal.
Grilled fruit of the desert.
A pretty flower from a prickly plant.
A weed. Of the sea.
Crispy.
Salty!
That's an odd looking carrot.
Looks yammy!
Looks even yammier!
Scientifical and nutritional.
I cooked it!
A vegetable.
Science says it's good for me.
Beans. With legs.
I'm sure it tastes better than it looks.
A lovely science flower.
A delicacy.
Science says the sharp edges are good for my lungs.
It looks radishing.
I wonder if this makes it tastes better.
Too bad tuber.
I wonder if it's still poisonous?
It's a blooming tuber!
Did I cook the flower too?
Yuck. This vegetable came out of the dirt.
Cooked and high in fructose!
Kinda wrinkled.
It gets my pockets all wet and gross.
It's closer to a liquid than a solid.
Kind of high sodium content.
I'd shatter my teeth on that.
Uncooked stone fruit is the pits.
It's actually soft enough to eat now.
The number one breath enhancer.
Perfectly browned.
Looks crunchy.
A successful chemical reaction.
Nice and spicy.
It was already hot to begin with.
The apples of the earth.
A successful temperature experiment.
It's red because it's full of science.
Cooking's easy if you understand chemistry.
The perfect breakfast for a man of science.
I threw the recipe away and just kind of winged it.
The dragonfruit is very filling.
Sticks to my ribs.
Crunchy and delicious!
I probably should have made a jar.
A very leggy sandwich.
Fruity.
Sweet and savory.
Tastes like chicken, but I don't think it is.
Lunch on a stick.
Well, he won't be waking up again.
I cooked it myself!
A stew to put some meat on my bones.
It's an affront to science.
These turned out pretty good.
I don't know if I'm hungry enough.
That's a pretty gourd cookie!
An excellent source of fiber.
I'll be stuffed after eating this!
My dentist'd get mad if I ate this... but I don't have one.
Mmmm.
I hope this doesn't make me feel eel!
I'm waffling on whether I should add more syrup.
It tastes like nothing.
A bowl of foliage.
Avogadro's favorite dish.
I scream for ice cream!
Cryogenic watermelon.
Five alarm!
A healthy, natural snack.
No, not brain freeze! I need that for science!
Cooking that sure kept me bisque-y!
But I don't have chopsticks.
Can I get a bigger bowl? This one looks a little shrimpy.
Smells delicious and energizing!
Jelly-O pop it right in my mouth!
Could use more salt, but that's none of my bisque-ness.
If I eat it in the morning is it still dinner?
It's a jumbo seafood gumbo.
It's shark fin-ished!
It's perf!
Sugary fruit! Part of a balanced breakfast.
There's got to be something else to eat around here.
Imagine the experiments I could run on it!
Sweet potato souffles are a rising trend.
I never had it before I came here.
I seasoned it with a dash of science.
Smells like it tastes.
With refried rock dwellers.
Chewy and confectionary.
I'm going to pretend I don't know what's in it.
I scream for iced tea.
Innocuous inoculation.
The best way to serve snake.
Can you use the celery as a straw?
Science says it's a hamburger.
Tea time!
We threw the recipe away and just kind of winged it.
Sticks to your ribs.
Probably should have made a jar.
It's just a big wad of meat.
A stew to put some meat on your bones.
Science help us.
It's really stuffing!
If I had a dentist they'd be mad I ate stuff like that.
I hope this doesn't make anyone eel!
I'm waffling on whether it needs more syrup.
One part jelly, one part bean.
No bones about it, Warly can cook.
I hope I can handle the spice level.
Is that just... frogs stuffed inside a fish?
How in science does it taste so good?
Warly sure can cook.
I've heard cooking is basically chemistry. I should try it.
He's as talented a chef as I am a scientist.
It's a little spooky.
What a mouthful!
I forgot what good food tasted like.
Potato, scientifically infused with the power of a tornado!
So... hot...!
It's shockingly delicious.
Each one is a tiny mystery.
It's a carrot seed.
It's a corn seed.
It's a weird fruit seed.
It's a durian seed.
It's an eggplant seed.
It's a pome-whatsit seed.
It's a pumpkin seed.
I cooked all the life out of 'em!
Looks delicious!
Without these, it's just a butter.
I can't believe it's butter!
It's a furry ball of rotten food.
Ew! It stinks!
It's thick and pliable. And salty.
Roasted to perfection.
It's buzzing with tastiness!
It's a melon seed.
Squishy.
Food for thought.
My very own plant eggs.
Evidence of my hard labor.
Take that, tiny tree!
I bet I could find a use for it.
I could use this to make honey.
Water you think it does?
It's an aloe seed.
It's asparagus seeds.
It's a radish seed.

Don't Starve Together
Toasted SeedsToasted Seeds- 
That cooked the life right out of 'em!
It infuses the eater with the power of science!
A handful of odd seeds.
A handful of odd seeds.
A handful of seeds.
A handful of odd seeds.
A handful of odd seeds.
It's scientific!
A pile of mechanical parts.
All that's left after fire has done its job.
There's a perfectly scientific explanation for that.
It sparkles with inner warmth.
It sparkles with cold energy.
This gem is yellow.
It's green and gemmy.
It's an orange gem.
I made them with my face.
I should fill my pockets!
Another flavor of poop.
They are all melted together.
It's just a cheap replica.
The knot is stuck. Forever.
It must be some kind of religious artifact.
Sadly, it's too small for me to escape on.
Their electricity carrying days are over.
I have no time for fun and games!
Great. All of my tub stopping needs are met.
I'm more of a zipper person, myself.
I hope I get out of here before I need these.
He whispers beautiful lies to me.
I'm not sure what I should do with a dessicated tentacle.
That seems really dangerous.
Poor little guy. He deserves a proper funeral.
Bits of bone.
There's SCIENCE afoot!
Only poison can cure poison.
I'm rich!
Chilling.
Someone wrote me a note!
I'm not terribly curious about the smell.
The label says 'Jay's Wondrous Snake Oil!'
I don't intend to harp on the issue.
I wonder how old this artifact is?
I can perform amputations if anyone'd like to wear it for real.
What is this substance?
This thing gives me the creeps...
Incredible! This guitar has undergone shrinkification!
How did this get all the way out here?
A relic of a bygone era!
Clouding of the brain... never heard of it...
I'm sure someone would like this.
Someone lost their words.
I wonder where the false one is?
Where's the other one?
An instrument of some sort.
I ought to measure it to make sure it's to scale.
Looks kinda soggy.
Scientific!
That's a key.
Something somewhere must be locked.
This key probably unlocks something.
It's oddly monkey-sized.
It's gotta be worth something.
I'm rich!
A coin worth my gentlemanly stature.
For hammering out the details.
A priceless piece of history.
The relic of an ancient culture.
Looks valuable.
A regal relic.
It's an old fancy feast.
A nasaltelepathical bug communicator.
Ahoy there, alloy!
Bug coating.
Perfect for a gentleman scientist.
At last a home for my science.
It must have scientifical properties.
Royal-key.
City engineering isn't a real science.
Maybe I can trade it for something.
Says 
Comedy in a can.
It's only gross when they're not your own.
Melted. Maybe Willow had some fun with them?
What's kazoo with you?
There's no time for fun and games!
They've quickly become Wes' favorite prop.
Hal whispers beautiful lies to me.
That's just asking to be experimented on.
It's hauntingly beautiful.
It hurts my soul to look at that thing.
It's giving me the creeps.
Something is up with that flower!
I don't know if I should hang on to this.
I'd die to find out what it does.
It's a prettier axe than I'm used to.
It looks like clown currency.
How are they floating?
Spooky.
It's REALLY scientific!
Black and white fur.
A picture of a sculpture. We'll need somewhere to make it.
A picture of some fishing tackle. I bet I could make this...
There is power emanating from it.
The power of science must have reanimated it...
It must be some kind of religious artifact.
Now if I only had some tea...
...Maxwell left his stuff out again.
A horrifyingly failed utensil fusion. I guess science *can* go too far.
I wonder what it's hiding?
It doesn't spin very well.
Wigfrid keeps jumping out and hitting me with it?!
This egg beater is all bent out of shape.
I have a few theories about this string.
I can put my shoes on without help, thanks.
Honestly, he just leaves them out wherever.
I think Wickerbottom had a cat.
It smells kind of stale.
Food and a cup! The ultimate survival container.
How Machiavellian.
If you unwound it you could poke someone from really far away.
It's always smart to keep an eye out.
That'll keep a watchful eye on the place.
It can see and be seen for miles!
No one could get lost with that thing looking out for them.
Makes a good marker, but I wish it'd stop looking at me.
That ought to show everyone the way.
This gem seems special.
It's scientifically proven that gems look better on top of sticks.
Brr! Chilling.
Someone might be interested in this.
This package is barely holding together.
That didn't go well. I'll have to try again.

AshesAshes of Thing- 

Divining RodDivining Rod (before picked up from its starting base)- 
That rod looks useful!
It's some kind of homing device.
The signal is very faint.
I'm headed in the right direction.
I must be getting pretty close.
This thing's going crazy!
I wonder what it does.
It looks like it needs a large key.
Now my machine can work!
I'm not sure I want to fall for that a second time.
So that's where the music was coming from.
I wonder how they work.
It really captures his personality.
I'll want to avoid stepping on that!
Oops.
Guh, that thing looks worse off than usual.
Looks almost like a key hole.
That doesn't look very comfortable.
He's trapped!
She's trapped!
It's trapped!
Now the machine can work!
He's a lot shorter in person.
It's a... thing.
I'm free! I'm finally free!
So cold!
Go for the eyes!
I will destroy you!
Here piggy piggy!
I'm going to stomp you dead!
Better you than me!
I sure showed him!
He's too fast!
I'll let him go. This time.
He's too gross anyway.
Shoo, you nasty thing!
BEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!
It's getting late. It will be dark soon.
It's so dark!
I can see again!
It's too dark to see!
I can't do that.
I don't have all the ingredients.
That doesn't go there.
It's too bright out.
I'm not tired.
I'm too hungry to sleep, the growling will keep me up!
It's too dangerous right now!
I'll try again in a second.
Maybe I'll just hold on to this.
Too unconscious to care.
Are you still hungry, plant?
Did you hear that?
Did you feel that?
That sounded big!
I can't carry any more stuff!
It's full.
That can't go in there.
I can't cook right now.
It's too far away!
I can't shave that!
There isn't even any stubble left!
I'm not going to try that while he's awake.
I think it's fine as is.
I know better than to bother an angry beefalo!
It won't let me do that while it's angry.
I can't place that from way up here.
Yum!
I think that was starting to turn.
Yuck! That was terrible!
I don't feel so good.
I'm so hungry!
Oops.
My light just ran out!
Ow!
I think I can fix this!
That doesn't sound good.
Safe from that frightening lightning!
Need... ice... or... shade!
Thanks for protection from the elements, tree!
Oh, H2O.
My clothes appear to be permeable.
Water way to go!
I've nearly reached my saturation point.
Wow that tool is slippery!
That thing is about to catch fire.
Yikes! That was hot!
That sounded big!
I don't exactly have a burning desire to sleep in that.
That doesn't sound good.
That can't be good.
I'm going to need a bigger boat...
Did you hear that?
That sounded big!
Here there be monsters.
It would seem my future is foggy.
I think I felt something brush against my leg...
Weeeee!
I need to get to land!
I think I sprung a leak.
I seem to be sinking.
My net filled up!
I could've sworn it was right there...
This seems to point to points unknown.

Can't buy item (not enough money)- 
I can't pay for that.
It's locked.
My house is in the Hamlet, not here.
Cough! Cough!
This {item} is too hot.
My nose feels.. itchy.
I don't want to claw my eyes out anymore.
For Science!
AHHH CHOOOO!
I don't like the look of this.
I'm too hungry to sleep, my growling tummy will keep me up!
I'm too scared of dying to sleep right now!
I've already got a pet.
All the monsters came back!
Die, doe!
oOooOooo!!
This beast seems to be wounded.
Someone beat me to the saddle!
We're taking on a lot of water.
I don't want to drown!
I already know that one.
I can't learn that one.
This map was made for some other place.
I need to see the moon for that to work.
Someone beat me to it.
It won't fit.
I need something to build with.
Whoops! Wrong plans.
Looks like we had the same idea.
They're elbow deep in junk right now.
I should wait my turn.
I'm not a fancy enough chef for that.
There's only room for one scribbler.
I don't think that was right.
It's not quite the right shape.
The ceiling is destabilizing!
This compass doesn't point anymore.
Now's not the time to flee this fight!
I can see the light!
It was worth a shot.
Perhaps this is a bad idea.
I wonder who set that flare?
My humanity is about to start slipping away...
I don't feel well enough.
There's no way to beat it now!!
It called for help!
Whoops! That wasn't right.
I'm a little preoccupied!!
I'm not sure that was science.
There's a form trapped inside.
I've almost got it out.
You're free!
A living log would probably be of more use.
A mushroom would probably be of more use.
I'm not sticking that in there!
This gem won't work here.
Uh, is it supposed to smell like that?
It looks better already.
I can't eat that!
Putting that in my mouth would be disgusting!
Did I just hear trees screaming?
I'll try again in a second.
Maybe I'll just hold on to this.
Your pockets are too full!
Too unconscious to care.
I can't open presents with monsters about!
I should get off my beefalo first.
That would be a waste of a bath bomb.
I can't, the surface is glassed over.
I can't change while it's on fire!
I'm wet, but alive.
My fan has gone with the wind.
I feel so accomplished!
If only my friends could see me now...
I hate parties.
There is a scientific solution, here. I know it.
Mwahahaha!
I'm sure I had a scientific reason for this.
This may prove to be my most dangerous experiment yet.
I've the brains AND the brawn.
Perhaps I'll retire to a life of rose breeding.
Brrrrr!
Oh yes, I'm cooking something up.
The root of all malady lies in an imbalance of the humors.
Stand back. I'm going to do SCIENCE!
Obsidious.
I can see into his pores.
I'm not sure if I want to open it.
Why did I even make a pitchfork this fancy?
Is that how I got here?
Someone must live here.
It's no use to me out there!
It's almost like someone is trying to prevent me from going somewhere.
Smells like bacon.
A chunk of ground.
It's probably a tuft of grass.
A crusted over lava pit.
Nice and comfy.
The lava's crusting over.
Looks fragile.
Bottled mosquito rage!
Aaah! Bug off!
How convenient!
Well, that was easy.
It doesn't look finished! It could be dangerous.
OW! I don't think it's ready yet.
It smells of bacon!
I'm not strong enough to wield it.
Just bits and pieces of rock.
I find the shards get in my food.
Ow!
Oh good. Now there's more of him.
If I had any friends, this could take me to them.
If I step through, will I still be me?
It seems to be popular over there.
Produces a lot of heat, but not much light.
Is it winking at me?
I don't think it's supposed to look like that.

I hope it dries off soon.
He might make a good distraction for us.
It's a packet of seeds.
Gone to seed.
I think someone planted this on me.
A little seedy.
A mixed bag.
A packet packed with seeds.
It has a lot on its plate.
Well bowl me over.
Soup's on!
This should tide me over.
That's what all the wheat is for.
I've masta-d this pasta.
Full of fresh vegetables.
I'm pro-protein.
Science says fatty acids are good for me.
Not as crabby as I thought.
Cheese it!
This dessert won't desert you.
It looks meaner than usual.
Nothing more than a dressed up thief.
Yikes!
Yikes! Get me back to land!
Will it grow again?
One day it may return.
Farewell, sweet plant.
It's a coffee maker.
The quintessential pirate sail.
To catch a big fish, you need a big rod.
Sandy ground.

SNAKE_FIRE- 
Is that snake smoldering?
Ouch.
It's a tiny meat beast.
It's a little chicken.

Wilson PortraitInspecting self- 
Am I still in one piece?
It's for me to put my stuff in.
It's better to sleep.
I can sleep in here when I'm hurt.
I get crazy when I don't sleep.
I could heat this up near the fire.
It's stone cold.
It's warm and cuddly... for a rock!
Nice and toasty hot!
A most potent dish.
It doesn't look finished. It could be dangerous!
Ow! I don't think it's finished yet!
This science is now out of control!
What a nice hat.
There was someone here before me!
Such a touching stone.
Better him than me!
I wonder if that rock could be moved.
It's probably hiding something.
Did that just move?
Good thing it's contained!
What a nasty little blood sucker.
A monkey with little brain.
It's a seed.
It's getting late. I need to make a fire.
I feel so smart now!
Never stop learning!
I didn't learn very much from that.
In you go!
Poooop!
Let me axe you a question!
I will unlock the secrets of ... grass.
I can learn stuff by reeding!
This probably isn't the best use of flint.
There must be science hiding somewhere in there.
Now I should build it!
My torch just ran out!
Go to good world of dreams little beefalo.
I wouldn't want to pick a bone with the owner.
The trail ends here.
It might be okay if it was cooler.
Poor guy. I should put him to rest.
It's a seed.
This should keep the water out.
I see no possible downsides to using this.
And so I sail away into the horizon...
That is a large nut.
It requires a large nut hacker.
I can't see the bottom!
That seems safe.
It's broken.
I think bloating has begun...
I wonder where that crab went?
He seems open to trading.
Maybe starving wouldn't be so bad...
Surf's up!
This map doesn't correlate to my current surroundings.
Oh, the science I could get up to with this!
Poison tipped.
Fire tipped.
These blasted mosquitos carry a sickness.
What a show-off.
These guys again.
Let's see if we can come to an arrangement.
Should let me mount some smelly animal.
I can take the saddle off now.
I seem to have discovered a cure!
This is why we can't have nice things.
Maybe I can be even more handsome!
So long, style.
For making some much needed repairs.
At least I won't die of boredom.
I might die of boredom.
Something's coming!!
Huh. It looks kinda like a key.
Don't poison me, please!
It's on a road to nowhere.
Someone beat that clock.
A baby barbecue.
Laboratory tools for butchery.
I can put a good meal together in a pinch.
It's good if you don't think about where it came from.
For drowning desserts in.
I need more than a penny for my thoughts.
Feels less than a pound.
It looks sick. More so than usual.
It's rickety, but it appears to function. After a fashion...
Uh, is it supposed to smell like that?
It looks pretty sick.
Is it staring at me? ...No, maybe not.
Why'd it have to be so big?
Is that a mirror?
It's Wilson!
Stars and atoms! It's %s!
That Wilson looks shifty...
Murderer!
Wilson, friend of ghosts.
Wilson could use a heart.
Better concoct a revival device. Can't leave a fellow scientist floating.
It's Willow!
That Willow looks shifty...
Murderer!
Willow, friend of ghosts.
Willow could use a heart.
It's Wolfgang!
That Wolfgang looks shifty...
Murderer!
Wolfgang, friend of ghosts.
%s, friend of ghosts.
Wolfgang could use a heart.
It's Wendy!
That Wendy looks shifty...
Murderer!
Wendy, friend of ghosts.
%s, friend of ghosts.
Wendy could use a heart.
I'm seeing double! I'd better concoct a revival device.
It's WX-78!
That WX-78 looks shifty...
Murderer!
You've violated the first law!
WX-78, friend of ghosts.
Looks like %s got that empathy module up and running.
WX-78 could use a heart.
It's Wickerbottom!
That Wickerbottom looks shifty...
I think she's planning to throw the book at me.
Murderer!
Wickerbottom, friend of ghosts.
Wickerbottom could use a heart.
It's Woodie!
Good day, %s!
That Woodie looks shifty...
Murderer!
Woodie, friend of ghosts.
Woodie could use a heart.
It's Wes!
That Wes looks shifty...
Murderer!
Wes, friend of ghosts.
Wes could use a heart.
It's Maxwell!
That Maxwell looks shifty...
Murderer!
Maxwell, friend of ghosts.
Maxwell could use a heart.
She's gone berserk!
It's %s!
Flesh is flesh. Where do I draw the line?
Cooked nice and pink, but still morally gray.
Letting it dry makes it not come from a human, right?
Melted. Did the arsonist have a go at these?
They've quickly become the mime's favorite prop.
It's hauntingly beautiful.
It's not the weirdest thing I've seen...
I'm dying to find out what it does.
The magician left his stuff out again.
Maxwell left his stuff out again.
Now I can scratch my back; all my problems are solved!
Why does the Viking keep jumping out and hitting me with it??
Maybe I'll brush up on some string theory.
I think the librarian had a cat.
Good, I can hang my clothes up if I ever find a hook.
A log would probably be of more use.
The toad is losing interest.
The toad got away.
The wilderness and I came to a compromise.
It's my trusty axe.
That's one fancy axe.
There's a lot going on underground.
I can't wait to dig holes.
Iconic, isn't it?
Hey, isn't gold really soft?
A sharpened rock tied to a stick. Hygienic!
Stop! It's time! To hammer things!
Maxwell might be looking for this.
The feather increases the scientific properties of the writing.
I bet the beefalo really like this.
That'll allow the mounting of some smelly animal.
The only problem is the saddle sores.
This saddle really flies!
This could take a saddle off.
How many licks does it take to get to the center?
I like the cut of this blade.
Hack in style!
Shearly delightful.
A trusty axe.
Now I just need an angry mob to join.
A scaled-down weighing device.
Sure beats darkness.
That fire is getting out of hand!
Good thing it's contained!
Nice and comfy.
The fire's getting a bit low.
I should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Well, that's over.
At least I can start it up again.
Something to hold back the night.
This will keep my hands free.
Spooky!
A more civilized light.
Sure beats darkness.
That fire is getting out of hand!
Good thing it's contained!
Nice and comfy.
The fire's getting a bit low.
I should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Well, that's over.
At least I can start it up again.
A wretched stench but excellent visibility.
Take that, wind!
A bottle full of sunshine.
This'll keep my hands free.
This will do wonders for my night-vision!
This fire pit is a conductor for even more... fire.
Good thing it's contained!
This is my best invention yet.
The fire's getting a bit low.
I should put something on the fire before it goes out.
At least I can start it up again.
Tar LampTar Lamp- 
That's a real slick lamp.
Science protects my fires out here.
I'm glad we're surrounded by water.
It's getting low.
Better put something on it before it goes out.
It finally went out.
What a bright idea!
A hat, made of bat.
That fire needs more fuel or it's going to go out.
A hands-free way to brighten your day.
It's a big, science-y 'shroom.
Science makes it light up.
Comboletely burnt.
We could make a prime light source with some primary colors.
Blue is obviously the most scientific color.
I didn't mildew it, I swear.
It's her lucky lighter.
You could fit a whole lot of science in there.
I feel kinda bad for that.
Gives me a net advantage!
For catching bugs.
It makes me hungry just to look at it.
It smells like wet.
It's so warm and comfy.
I get sort of crazy when I don't sleep.
I wove it real tight.
Seems sterile enough.
The stinging means that it's working.
This will keep my hair dry, at least.
North.
South.
East.
West.
Northeast.
Southeast.
Northwest.
Southwest.
Which way am I facing?
Wrapping things up should make them easier to carry.
I need to have something to wrap.
Our supplies are in there!
The fur keeps the temperature inside stable.
Down to bring my temperature down.
A nice place for an afternoon rest out of the heat.
Night is for sleeping, not taking siestas.
It's too dangerous right now!
I'm too hungry for a siesta!
I don't think I could really relax down here.
Nothing left to sleep in.
It won't provide much shade now.
I could manipulate its temperature.
It's colder than ice.
That's a cold stone.
It's quite warm and cuddly... for a rock!
Nice and toasty hot!
This will keep my hair moderately dry, at least.
I call it a thatchel.
I can keep my booty in here.
I hate when food has that not-so-fresh taste.
Down to bring my temperature down.
I have a strange desire to name it after myself.
My hair looks good wet... it's when it dries that's the problem.
Tastes horrible!
Shade, sweet shade.
Take that, bugs!
For the birds.
This little piggy's gone... 
Hook, line and stick!
I always hate when my hair gets wet and poofy.
Down to bring the temperature down.
My hair looks good wet... it's when it dries again that's the problem.
The beating of this hideous heart will bring a ghost back to life!
A scientific breakthrough! The cure!
What a scientific marvel!
Somehow the breeze comes out the back twice as fast.
I can light it to let everyone know I'm here.
It's all scorched.
That teddy bear is moving around. Interesting.
Remind me not to get on Willow's bad side.
It finally fell apart.
A breakthrough in culinary science!
It makes me hungry just to look at it.
This is going to take a while.
It's almost done!
Mmmmm! It's ready to eat!
That can't go in there.
Bees!
It's empty.
I should wait a bit.
It's full of honey.
I should try planting some crops.
Go plants go!
Mmmm. Ready to harvest.
I think it needs to be fertilized.
I have harnessed the power of cold!
I should dry some meats.
Meat takes a while to dry.
Jerky time!
The pot got cooked.
How did it get burned?!!
I don't think anything will grow in a pile of ash.
Meat takes even longer to dry in rain.
The rack got dried.
That is definitely a bucket full of poop.
I'm really going to stick it to those mussels.
I should find a good spot for these.
I need to find some fish eggs for this.
The fish babies haven't hatched yet.
There's a fish!
The fish are still multiplying.
This has been a successful fish experiment!
I'd better start harvesting these!
Water you think it's for?
Need to wait a bit.
It could use a spore. Or a mushroom transplant.
It should keep growing now.
The mushrooms have really taken to the log.
That's a lot of mushrooms!
I might be able to fix it with a fresh log.
The power of science compelled it.
I don't think it can grow in this cold.
Now we're cookin'!
Now we're done cookin'!
It mixes all the food.
This will spice things up.
Should make things a little tastier.
It breaks down objects into their scientific components.
It's even more science-y than the last one!
I am one heck of a scientist.
It measures cloudiness.
I can harness the heavens!
The power is mine!
It looks like pepper.
It won't be doing much science now.
The extra science didn't keep it alive.
Its measuring days are over.
The measuring parts went up in a cloud of smoke.
All quiet on the flinging front.
Fling on!
The fuel tank is getting a bit low.
It's whirring with electricity.
For sea science!
It's putting along!
It's running great!
It's putting along.
It seems to be slowing down.
I can hear it sputtering.
It needs more fuel.
I can get more tar if I used this at sea.
I smelt that!
Fan-tastic.
Mercurial.
To harness the heavens!
Now I can show everyone what I found!
So much for that.
Nothing but ash now.
We can make stone sculptures with this.
Burnt right down.
Not even science could make that into a sculpture.
Ready for sculpting.
We already put something there.
A masterpiece!
We already know that one.
I think tanks are in order.
The science has been lost to sea.
I want to use it, and I want the world to know that I did.
That's one pointy stick.
This seems unsanitary.
Aerodynamical!
Ow! I should try to catch that!
Good practice for my birthday cake!
Just don't breathe in.
This seems fundamentally unsafe.
I don't like sports.
I hope there are no bugs in this.
That is a perfectly reasonable piece of clothing.
This looks really heavy.
It buzzes when I shake it.
This is a nasty surprise.
Hot mail!
It's electric!
Spinning doom.
Now it's extra deadly.
The pointy end goes that way.
I'll need to light it first.
This seems dangerous.
Science takes care of me.
I hope this sword doesn't start to smell...
Nice and dry. This helmet will protect me from the elements.
Arts and crafts!
I'm sure this will hold up great!
The best defense is a good offense.
Now I can't be caught off-guard.
Put a cork in it.
Yeesh. This is kinda creepy.
There's still some goo stuck to the insides.
It's brittle.
Protects my brains.
Science says I'm safe in here.
Well, this will come in handy.
Hopefully there aren't any bugs in it.
It buzzes when shaken.
Pretty fancy hat, that.
It feels very stabby.
It has shocking accuracy.
Nothing like loud noises to help keep the peace.
It makes snooze circles when I throw it.
At least my hair will stay dry.
I should put a bird in it.
That's my bird!
Awwww, he's asleep.
These pigs have pretty fancy houses.
I can see a snout pressed up against the window.
Come ON! I know you're home!
That's not a real carrot.
This seems like a bad idea.
Hmmmm. I guess that'll have to do.
Pickets!
Pointy!
They make me feel so safe.
That's a nice wall.
It's my tickle trunk!
It says 'You are here'.
A fern in a pot.
It's not much use like this. We should place it.
We should draw something on there.
This'd be easier if I had the item in front of me.
I could draw better than that!
All we need to build a nice, sturdy fence.
It's just a wood fence.
All we need to build a nice, sturdy gate.
It opens. And closes sometimes, too.
Not so fancy now, pig!
That's not a real roasted carrot.
That won't do at all.
Burnt!
That trunk was truncated.
Next best thing to a lockbox!
I can't read it any longer.
Look what I made!
It's a sandcastle, in the sand!
What a bore-ing house.
Here be evil.
These would do more good if I placed them.
Sturdy.
Even goons gotta sleep.
Sand technology on the go.
Keeps the water at bay.
Ahoy!
It's broken.
Awww yaaaaa Buoy!
Watertight, just like all my theories.
The place where the ballphins roost.
I have to build it in the water.
I shelled out for the good stuff.
Room for two. Or three.

Don't Starve Together
Birdcage BuildBirdcage- 
Now it just needs a bird.
Who's a good bird?
It's a tickle trunk!
He's looking a bit peckish.
Did I forget to feed you?
Maybe he's just resting?
That bird is definitely deceased.
It says 'Thataway'.
The sign is currently blank.
'Don't play with matches.'
I should put something in there.
A flower in a vase on a table.
It's nice to have a little light.
Did we remember to pick up new bulbs?
Not looking too fresh.
A burnt vase on a burnt table.
All dressed up and no where to crow.
Someone made that strawman eat crow.
Someone MURDERed that scarecrow!
Very light, but surprisingly tough.
Spacey and smooth!
It's scalding!
It holds dark, forbidden secrets...
That's burning fast!
It's outta style now.
I don't want to change right now.
It's too dangerous right now!
It can only handle one style change at a time.
A succulent in a pot.
Looks fit for a swamp king!
There was something fishy about that throne anyway.
Just what is she planning?
I suppose we'll never know what it was for now.
Some short lengths of rope.
Boards.
I've made them seductively smooth.
Some sheets of paper.
It contains the mysteries of the universe.
This stuff is crazy!
Beeswax is a scientifically proven preservative!
Some sheets of wax paper.
Soft cloth made from hard root!
Looks like a useful building material.
Just an empty bottle.
I want nubbin to do with that.
Science at work.
Seductively smooth.
I should stick something shiny in it. For research.
I traded the old family cow for it.
I'm making a quillt!
What a handsome devil!
Who would name something that?
What have I created?
I can serenade the animals.
It gives off a spooky light.
Wearing this makes me feel safe and insecure.
I dreamed it myself!
I should have added a beefalo bell.
I bet I could fly if I held two of these.
A soggy, sustaining, succulent suit.
Cool as ice!
It's whispering to me.
I feel so safe when I'm wearing it.
I don't want to set the world on fire.
It's cold to the touch.
It can show me the world.
It's ready to go.
It needs more purple gems.
Looks ready.
It needs a gem.
Not much use anymore.
Fire doesn't really solve naming issues...
Whatever it was, it's burnt now.
Dingalingaling.
It's twisting my tongue.
Fire doesn't really solve naming issues...
Is it dripping...?
More science for my brain!

Pugalisk WandPugalisk Wand- 
Sends shivers down my spine.
Entrance-ing.
That's exit-ing!
It's alive. ALIVE!
It rooted out all my things!
Ha ha! Take that nightmares!
To serenade the animals.
Wearing that makes me feel safe and insecure.
Why would anyone make this? It's terrifying.
We should add a beefalo bell.
I bet I could fly if I held two of them.
I feel so safe when I get to wear it.
That could reveal the world.
That's an entirely scientific mapping tool.
Water amplifies the science, allowing us to measure the moon.
It's a new moon.
The moon is waxing.
It's a full moon.
The moon is waning.
There's no moon down here to measure.
This pyramid controls the sands.
Ready for departiculation.
I guess science works differently up North.
That thing's giving ME goosebumps!
A perfectly normal cursed moose thing.
Darn it! Darn it all to heck!
At least my ears won't get cold...
Hats always ruin my hair.
That's a case of hat-hair waiting to happen.
This should keep me protected.
I AM A BIRD!
It'll be good for when winter comes.
What a nice hat.
This vest is dapper as all get-out.
Wilderness casual.
Winter survival gear.
It's kind of scratchy.
It smells like prettiness.
It makes walking seem much easier!
Ears hat!
Let the juice run down your face.
Stay cool, boy.
Keeps the rain where it ought to be. Outside my body.
It'll mess up my hair, but I'll stay nice and dry.
Keep off, evil sun!
It's not lab-safe!
It will watch over me.
Welcome to hibernation station!
Two brains means double the ideas!
Should repel the rain.
How fashionable!
Well, it's something.
The wind doesn't stand a chance!
I'll pitch a fit if I have to wear that.
Sucks all the stink out.
It really cuts through the air!
What a dangerous looking hat.
The second umbrella keeps the first umbrella dry.
Now I can breath anywhere.
Pithy.
Does this hat make me look scientific?
Makes you warm and fuzzy inside. Outside, too.
Protects your skin, but squashes your meticulous coiffure.
BECOME THE BIRD!
Technically walking is just controlled falling.
Keeps the rain where it ought to be. Outside your body.
Messy hair... the terrible price of dryness.
It watches over the wearer.
What a stylish pair of goggles.
Quality eye protection.
Makes the wearer look like a fun guy.
Sometimes you have to feel worse to feel better.
Finally, I can show my face in public.
I wonder where this is from?
A solid piece of history.
An ancient piece of wall.
All is well.
Getting pretty magical around here.
I think it's becoming more concentrated!
It seems to be staying steady.
Feels like it's receding.
The nightmare is almost gone!
There's no magic around here.
Teleportation can be so useful.
Warm to the touch.
Just when I thought I couldn't get any better.
This beats walking.
I put a gem on a stick.
This will come in handy.
It's brilliant!
Fit for a king. Or me.
It's oddly light.
It has quite a heft to it.
I think it's sleeping.
I hope it doesn't turn on me.
It's becoming more concentrated!
No base should be without one!
A genius invention... a gem on a stick.
How's my hair?
This looks... boat-like...
This looks... adequate...
It runs on elbow grease.
It has room for all my stuff!
That is one durable boat.
A mere shell of a ship.
A vessel fit for a scallywag.
This will add some float to my boat.
This should really transform my boating experience.
That wind isn't getting away now!
Scale it and sail it!
It's feather-light!
This is how a scientist should travel.
The only thing better than a boat is a boat with a cannon.
Does my ingenuity know no bounds?!
For the deadliest catch.
It's not in shipshape right now.
For keeping my ships in tiptop shape!
I'll need to refill that soon.
I have to turn it on.
It's running smoothly.
I need to refuel that.
Nothing but net.
It's bulging with potential!
I think it's sinking.
It is definitely sinking.
I spy with my little eye...
I can see forever!
The proper boating attire!
Fit for a cutthroat scallywag. Or me.
Does it make me look scurvy... I mean scary!?
Keeps me afloat without my boat!
An accident waiting to happen.
It's hot to the touch.
A winning combination!
This will leave a mark.
I'm a genius.
It's even bombier!
I can hear the wind trapped within.
There must be a scientific explanation for this.
The label says 'Keep out of reach of children'.
A trap for traps!
It's a tiny little hammer.
Critics panned it.
Science awaits!
Lusterless.
Plain fire. No science involved.
Both a house, and a home.

The Sterling Trough Deli- 
A place to eat.
A common store full of common goods.
I could use a fix-me-up.
There's fresh produce in there.
A garden variety shop.
A lot of strange things in there.
This could put a twinkle in my eye.
Instruments of destruction.
A place to hang your hat.
I can smell the history.
Ah. A useful place for a change.
For science-ing!
The local lawmaker.
I'm a Gentleman Politician now.
It says I can hire my own town guard.

Slanty Shanty BuildSlanty Shanty (owned)- 
Home sweet home.
It's surprisingly sturdy.
My new lab awaits!
Time to demonstrate some demolition.
Totally floored.
It's the floor.
A-floor-dable.
A stone cold floor.
A geometric ton of flooring.
Wipes the floor with the other flooring.
I 'wood' not say no to someone finishing this.
Totally floored.
Stone cold floor.
Totally floored.
Totally floored.
Geometric ton of flooring.
A place to put stuff.
Basic.
It could use some work.
Nice use for a ladder.
Functional.
This doesn't make sense.
A place to hang stuff.
A place to hang your hat.
It's a potted plant.
It's still a work in progress.
That's fancy.
A fancy way to hold a plant.
A fancy way to hold a fancy plant.
A holder for a fancy plant.
A fancy way to hold a boring plant.
A hanging plant.
A plant cage.
It's like a pet that grows!
Those look hungry.
It's a growing chandelier!
It's bent out of shape over something.
Is it that time of year already?
Stable enough.
Adds some stability.
Adds some fancy stability.
A bunch of wood.
A chunk of checkered stuff put on a wall.
Some fancy stuff put on a wall.
Pretty paper on a wall.
Pretty paper on a wall.
It's a wall.
It's a wall.
I'm 'knot' going to say anything bad about it.
Pretty paper on a wall.
'Marble'ous piece of wall.
It's a wall.
Kind of square.
Im-'plush'-onable.
Looks pretty sad.
Very functional.
A fancy hanging light.
It could use some decoration.
Two boring lights.
Fancy hanging light.
A fancy light.
Someone left their hat up there.
Who's that kid?
Now I can look at my gentlemanly figure.
How cozy.
Well that's nice.
I have an axe to grind with this.
In-spear-ed.
Science-y.
A little dramatic.
Science says it's bad for your health.
Is this bad luck, or good?
So that's where the smell is coming from.
He looks unhappy.
I could sit on that.
Someone could sit on that.
A couple people could sit on that.
A spiky seat.
Somewhere to rest my feet.
I don't trust it.
A comfy chair to sit on.
That chair is rocking!
Seat. Foot rest. The ottoman has many uses.
A chair to chaise after.
Builds a small domicile.
Builds a simple residence.
Builds a dwelling with some character.
Builds a brickwork residence.
Builds a reasonable shelter.
Builds a considerable home.
Builds a sizable habitation.
I wood like to see whats through there.
That door rocks.
I feel like it's watching me.
A door I can go through.
A door I can go through.
A door I can go through.
A little like being eaten.
I hope that bat is dead.
Lets in some sunlight.
Not exactly high class.
It's a window.
It's a window. A tall window.
Lets in some sunlight.
It's a window. That's tall.
A big window.
I feel like someone's watching me.
Kind of square.
It's a rug.
It covers a lot of ground.
A dead animal someone left on the floor.
I can step on you!
Did an animal step on this or is it just decoration?
Swirlish.
There's a dead animal on the floor.
Good for the lab.
Oh what a tangled web we weave...
I better test its metal.
Just a reproduction.
Is that my beard?
I think they nailed it.
Murderous.
Geometrical.
A fancy lamp.
A pretty lamp.
Two for the price of one.
An old fancy lamp.
Two for the price of one!
A little plain.
This one could use a lampshade.
A practical lamp.
It's a round table.
I could get some work done there.
Pretty basic.
Interesting decor...
I could put things on that.
Check and mate.
A blank map. Doesn't seem very useful.
You'd make a good lab assistant.
Pretty cute for a lil monster!
Much less mucusy than its momma.
It's wyrmed its way into my heart.
What an aerodynamical creature!
My feathered friend.
I keep her around because she's good at mothematics.
It makes me hungry just looking at it.
That was never really my thing.
I can relate.
It's even heavier than it looks.
It's a horse, of course.
It's a stone bishop.
The chess pieces are moving themselves!
Hmm...looks familiar.
That doesn't look so kingly to me.
I feel like its eye follows you.
It was a lot bigger up close.
Eurgh. It's so lifelike.
Ah, that brings back memories. Bad ones.
It looks nice, doesn't it?
It's as heavy as it looks.
I've been feeling pretty inspired lately.
I only worship science.
Stuff for science!
I've made it extra effective.
I'm not really cut out for fighting.
It's just textbook chemistry.
It would be nice to do some experiments on the water.
Manual ship acceleration.
Just in case of disaster.
Now I can build an anchor.
Now I can build a mast.
Spread my wings and sail away!
That's going to be the steering wheel.
The foreword just says 'Hope you like dragoons.'
No point studying when I can just wing it.
I see no farm in reading that.
Strange, it's just 500 pages of telegraph codes.
The beginning was dull, but got better near the end.
Someone'll get suckered into reading this.
Good for mending.
She's made a sort of automatic defense system.
It needs some electricity.
It's on fire!
Science couldn't save it.
What an ingenious idea!
Looks science-y. How does it work?
It's getting low on power.
I could get it working, if Winona's busy.
Hey! That's not science!
It'll turn off soon.
Science beats magic, every time.
The best offense is a good defense.
It'd really poke whoever stepped on it.
Wormwood offered me a bite, but I respectfully declined.
A powerfully potent powder.
Sweet! It's sweet!
A flagon of fiery fluid.
A little sodium's good for the heart.
It's some sort of delicious pocket dimension for sugary treats.
The cavities are probably worth it, right?
What corruption of science grew these?
My teeth are going to have something to say about this tomorrow.
Much better tasting than the real thing.
Only a sucker wouldn't love this.
They wriggle on the way down.
Sticks to your teeth.
It's... corn.
Everyone'll be raisin' a fuss over these.
I... don't think I'll be eating those.
Did that candy just move?
Oh, my poor jaw.
I don't do well with spice.
I don't believe in the supernatural.
I know someone who'd have a ball with this!
Hard to find a good flask around here.
I might need these after all that candy.
Let's make a wish. For science.
I hope this doesn't attract spiders.
I think it came from another world. One with grifts.
I wonder where the other one is?
Holding it makes me feel like bartering.
It's a little warm to the touch.
It's full of someone's childhood memories.
It's not very good at jumping.
It's some sort of plant specimen.
It's picking up frequencies from another world.
Maybe a tool for testing aerodynamics?
Sanity is a small price to pay for science!
Full of grit.
A potent potion.
I was hoping for something bigger.
Crystalized inferno.
Infused with transforming such-and-such.
Something's in there! I'll have to root it out.
It'll grow up big and horrifying.
Completely batty decoration.
Everyone's raven about tree decorations these days.
This wood look good hanging somewhere.
A spectornament I could hang in a tree.
Eight-armed adornment.
Almost i-tentacle to the real ones.
Did you see that?!
Those trees don't seem so spooky anymore.
That's a wrap!
Is that for me?
I need a pine cone for that.
That puts a damper on the festivities.
It's almost Winter's Feast!
Happy Winter's Feast!
That was a mistake, I think.
The anatomy's not right, but I'll overlook it.
That experiment may have been a tiny bit unethical.
I'm going to eat forty. For science.
A Yuletide toothache waiting to happen.
It's nice to eat something other than berries for once.
I'm puddin' that straight in my mouth!
It's a hollowed apple filled with yummy juice.
How does it stay warm? A thermodynamical mug?
Can science explain why it tastes so good?
Every scientist appreciates a good bauble.
A tree's not complete without some electricity.
This one is especially impressive.
I should hang this one over a fire.
For some reason it makes me hungry.
I feel like it wants something.
I've got to plant something there.
That won't do at all.
Is there something inside that?
What a lucky find!
Filled with explosion science!
This lantern feels more special than the others.
It's inordinately large.
So who gets to be the head?
I'm middling on this middle piece.
Someone has to bring up the rear.
I should make something fun.
I need to put a torch in it.
It burned down.
This'd stop a dog in its tracks.
It's been unleashed!
It looks so real.
A terror cotta monster!
Did it just move?
A picture of a sculpture. We'll need somewhere to make it.
And I didn't even get eaten!
That thing's the leashed of my worries.
More stuff to make.
It's hungry for meat.
Burnt out.
A feast fit for me.
A meal only a beast would love.
Nothing fancy.
This looks important.
Here's mud in your eye!
He's got gold fever!
Wouldn't you rather hit someone else?
What are you looking at?
It's too late for that now.
I need to clean up first.
It's too dangerous for that right now.
That's the guy in charge here.
I can take him!
This one's got bite.
Its shell is so spiky!
That spit is corrosive!
He's got a strong arm on him.
You sure are big!
He's got a nose for this kind of work.
I can smell him from here!
That's how we got here. Hopefully how we get back, too.
I'll just be going now.
It needs a key.
That should do it.
This is where those enemies are coming from.
Everyone, break the Battle Standard!
I guess they're fighting for us.
It's a rock monster!
It conducts regenerative energy.
It calls a meteor from above.
This'll keep those monsters held for a little while.
I can't make out the text.
It's a heavy hammer for hitting things.
I could do a quick charge with that.
It gets to the point.
That weapon's for throwing.
A sharp looking instrument.
That's a weapon I could use from range.
It uses a strong blast of air to propel a projectile.
It smells like brimstone.
Light, but not very durable.
Lightweight and designed for mobility.
It offers a decent amount of protection.
That could help me hit a little harder.
I'd have energy for a few more stunts wearing that.
That's as good as it gets.
This armor has been petrified for maximum protection.
That should keep me safe.
My strikes would hurt a little more wearing that.
It looks like it packs a wallop.
That could cause some major destruction.
Those fluffy feathers make me want to run!
Those crystals will quickened my abilities.
It has a gaze full of science.
Looks like it amplifies healing expertise.
The blossom interacts well with healing magic.
This garland will restore a bit of my vitality.
Let me help you.
Good as new!
Much better, thank-you.
I'm not skilled enough to use that.
Reminds me of my old nanny.
This goat's much smaller.
Maybe they'd be willing to trade.
I guess you're in charge around here?
It's sleeping, for now.
It's a super hairy pig.
Science says it should have died by now.
He's just winging it.
They're dead.
That rock's alive!
Those berries are all gone.
Probably chock full of vitamins.
Are those mushrooms? I'm stumped.
I don't think it's growing back.
I don't think the altar will want that.
I can't get anything else out of that.
It reminds me of those tentacle monsters.
I can't get anymore out of that shrub.
It's full of delicious, delicious sap.
Where'd the tree go? I'm stumped.
Here sappy, sappy, sap.
Sweet golden sap.
That's how you get ants.
It looks ill.
Kind of clingy.
We'd better start cooking some offerings.
It's in the process of digestinating.
Another dead end.
It's an old statue.
What are you looking at?
On the road to nowhere.
Preyed upon.
Something put a damper on that chimney.
That clock's been punched.
No longer a-door-able.
Someone hit the roof.
Take that, creature!
So lifelike.
It's seen better days.
Some pig's house was ruined.
The scientific term is: 'Sharp pointy thing'.
Locked tight.
Turns out a key was the key to getting in.
The daily grind.
Been a long time since it was hooked up to water.
As far as posts go, this one is adequate.
A monumental monument.
What an ugly little house.
It's a safe. For keeping things safe.
It won't open without the key.
Any science in there?
I could use some stuff.
A little salty spring.
Huh. Reminds me of home.
Enlightening.
Someone beat the clock. Literally.
Ashes to ashes.
Must have mis-spoke.
Kitchen stuff.
For suspension-based cookery.
It has hang-ups.
For scientifically burning things.
It needs ingredients to make the science work.
For grilling small meats.
Barbecurious.
I'll have to grill someone about this.
Now all I need is a backyard to put it in.
Let's get cooking!
This one holds more ingredients.
For making minuscule motleys.
A dish for all seasonings.
I need to sweeten this pot.
For harvesting salt from the pond.
Science takes time.
Salt has gathered on the rope.
A crabby trap.
It's a farming instrument.
Laboratory tools for surgical butchery.
We can use it to gather sap from the trees.
Safe bet this'll come in handy.
I'll park it in my pocket until I get to the park.
This looks science-y.
Sow what?
A handful of odd seeds.
Mm, fresh fish.
Ready for the dinner table.
No imitations here.
I can put a meal together in a pinch.
We cooked the foliage.
These are edible mushrooms.

GarlicGarlic- 
The number one breath enhancer.
Perfectly browned.
Looks crunchy.
A successful chemical reaction.
The apples of the earth.
A successful temperature experiment.
It's red because it's full of science.
Cooking's easy if you understand chemistry.
It's a raw turnip.
Cooking is science in practice.
It looks a bit grainy.
Ready for baking.
Good if you don't think about where it came from.
Salt. The tastiest mineral.
It's full of salt.
It tastes sweet.
Might as well toss it on the fire.
Adds sweetness to the mixture.
I could grind it up to make a spice.
Flavorful.
I'd like more than a penny for my thoughts.
A decent amount of coin.
Seems valuable.
We can use these to reopen the Gateway.
I should offer it on the Altar of Gnaw.
That's not what it wants.
Science says this will appease the sky God.
It's more of a light snack, really.
That one was an experiment.
A silver plated plate.
A bright bowl.
The gate is locked.
I only need to use one dish.
It needs another type of dish.
There's already a meal there.
It won't want to eat that.
I'll just have to find another key.
Science says I have to wait my turn.
Those ingredients didn't make anything.
I left it on too long.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Time to go!
It's all piney.
This sad tree has no cones.
Those spikes look sharp!
Take that, nature!
Not so spiky now!
What a waste of wood.
Spikes and fire!
I feel like I could have prevented that.
Now it's burnt and spiky.
It'll be a tree soon!
It's big, it's heavy, and it's wood.
That's some hot wood!
It's small, dark and smells like burnt wood.
I can hear a tiny tree inside it, trying to get out.
I don't think an axe will cut it.
Is it watching me?
It looks worried.
Baby trees are so cute!
That'll teach him.
That's burning fast!
It's a bunch of small twigs.
It's a tuft of grass.
I cut it down in the prime of its life.
It needs poop.
It's burning fast!
Cut grass, ready for arts and crafts.
Red berries taste the best.
Maybe they'll grow back?
I think it needs to be fertilized.
I should plant this.
It's a clump of reeds.
I picked all the useful reeds.
That's really burning!
Cut reeds, ready for crafting and hobbying.
Leafy!
Guh! It's growing so slowly!
Mmmm. Ready to harvest.
It's a plant.
It looks thorny.
Ouch.
That's burning fast!
It's pretty but it smells like a common laborer.
I showed those flowers who's boss!
Augh! It's so evil!
I'm not sure I want to hold these.
The earth is making plantbabies.
It's a mushroom.
It's sleeping.
I wonder if it will come back?
It's all leafy. Most of the time.
Take that, nature!
What a waste of wood.
I feel like I could have prevented that.
There's definitely something inside there.
It'll be a tree soon!
It might be okay if it cooled down.
It's not going to grow back while it's so hot.
Nothing will grow in this heat.
The heat killed it.
Sharp but delicious.
Deflated, but still spiny.
Who knows what that tumbleweed has picked up.
Looks pretty sturdy.
Bye bye, bamboo.
I feel like I could have prevented that.
That tree needs a hair cut.
What a waste of wood.
It's all viney!
Whoops.
Take that, nature!
I need to plant this.
I suppose I should pick it up.
It will grow into a nice jungle tree.
I can hear the hissing of tiny snakes.
Maybe I can bamboozle my enemies with this?
Maybe I can tie stuff up with this.
I hope you're thirsty, grass.
I wonder what it's plotting...
Is that what passes for food around here?
I wonder if it's getting enough water?
I wonder how that happened.
How tropical.
It doesn't need my help to grow anymore.
I'm fond of these fronds.
Just like any other tree.
Look. A plant.
I'm in-tree-ged.

Nettle VineNettle Vine- 
This plant's strong odor clears my sinuses.
I'm sure it will grow back.
It really doesn't like this dirt.
It looks all watered and happy.
Science says this needs dirt, fast!
An overly complicated spiky thing.
It's pretty, but is it worth the trouble?
Always hanging around.
It totally blocks out the sun.
The science is blooming well this season.

Lily PadLily Pad- 
It's full of science. I can tell.
A bit of ornamentation.
It's been neatly kept.
It looks like it could use a shave.
It's burning.
Glad that's over with.
To think the artist had only hoofs to work with.
Sure likes looking at itself.
Something big moved that there.
Looks bushed.
A sticky situation.
Science says it's a tree.
What could've broken that?
This needs to be planted.
It was cut down in the prime of its life.
It can be planted anywhere now.
I think those are the edible kind.
It's very much on fire.
Now it can be taken anywhere.
All the useful reeds have already been picked.
Sure showed those flowers who's boss!
I'm not sure I want to hold those.
How did this tree even reproduce?
It's all burnt up.
It's all sticky.
Take that, nature!
What a waste of wood.
I feel like I could have prevented that.
That tree looks pretty wimpy.
It doesn't need any help to grow.
There's a sticky tree inside it that wants to get out.
Err, something's not right.
It looks pretty sick.
I should leave them there until it's time to eat.
The bush is working hard on the next batch.
It won't make any berries in this state.
This could be replanted closer to home.
The heat even dehydrated the juicy berries!
It looks carved.
Makes sense to me.
To match my rosy cheeks.
Aloe there.
I could eat that, but I'd rather not.
Welp. It's kelp.
I just couldn't kelp myself.
I can plant it in deep water.
A dead tree that washed up on shore.
There might still be something worth digging up.
That driftwood's burning!
Doesn't look very useful anymore.
It floats on water.
I didn't know trees grew on the moon.
That was a pretty thick tree.
The tree is burning!
The tree burnt down.
It fell from the moon tree.
A moth turned into a tree? Lunacy!
It's a bush... From the moon!
It'll take a while to grow more fruit.
Its fruit growing days are over.
It's pretty hot out.
Err, something's not right.
It looks pretty sick.
It's burning!
It's growing.
It's buzzing with activity.
I think those bees are mad.
Bees used to live in this.
I've got no bones to pick with the owner. Really.
Creepy.
What an odd looking stone.
That's a CRAZY looking rock!
Where did the rest of it go?
TAKE THAT, SANE SELF!
It's more of a pyramid than an obelisk.
What has happened to the head?
I think I could use that.
Fancy!
Who would live here?
The stinkiest thing I'll smell all day.
Looks like an offering to the beast.
Sure looks cozy.
That's too strong to break through!
It wouldn't fit in my pocket.
I can make stuff with these.
It's a very sharp rock.
I'm not a geologist.
I can't eat it, but it sure is shiny.
I bet there's all sorts of good stuff down there!
I should probably feel bad about that.
It's a pile of dirt... or IS it?
Tracks left by food. I mean... an animal.
The beast's trail ends here.
This track is fresh, the beast must be nearby.
This appears to be the nexus to another world!
Soon my invention will be complete!
There's still something missing.
With this I can surely pass through space and time!
A ring that could focus dimensional energies.
Tough enough to handle the most intense experiments.
This thing may control the polarity of the whole universe.
This metal contains great and feared power.
Soft and undulating.
Science compels me to jump in.
That was not a sane thing to do.
I can't see the bottom!
Better you than me.
Sticky!
I hope these don't hatch in my pocket.
That must lead to the Kingdom of the Bunnymen.
It looks warm and cozy inside.
Looks like somebody was camping here.
That fellow looks like he wants to talk.
This is why I hate the water.
If only I had some way of hooking on to it from here.
Ice to meet you.
A very isolated glacier.
Nothing useful until it freezes again.
The wet ground won't hold a footprint.
What a nice hole in the ground for a home!
The Kingdom of the Bunnymen is closed for the season.
Nothing to live in, now.
Burnt merm flesh somehow smells even worse.
Crispy.
It's a den in a stump.
Its owner ran out of lives.
I'm not sure what that's supposed to be.
I broke it. For science.
Better him than... wait a minute!
It's even less seaworthy than before.
They call a dug hole in the sand their home.
Doesn't smell very good.
Who would live here?
Nothing to live in, now.
This area seems pretty fishy.
That Wascal is sleeping.
The coral have formed a reef!
Living building material!
That's a baby coral reef.
I could fill a pail with all those snails.
I can't fill a pail without snails.
I can dig it.
I see a golden opportunity.
Maybe I should stand back.
It looks like a premier steamer trunk.
You better stay out of my shoes.
A handy pile of pocket sand.
Is that sand pile purring?
That is a rather large pile of sand.
My scientific know-how tells me that's a perfectly safe mountain!
Do I hear cracking?
Something down there has bad breath.
I wonder where it went...
The water is too rough!
Follow those bubbles!
There must be a way to get that tar out.
Do I have to hold it with my bare hands?
Who's cleaning that up, I wonder?
A pool left by the tides.
A bit hot for my tastes.
I wonder if they are from Brussels.
I really stuck it to them.
I suppose I could linger for a moment or two...
Gives me an uneasy feeling.
I hope that thing is water proof.
Part of a wrecked ship.
There must be a way to open it.
It smells as bad as it looks.
Sea refuse.
Maybe I could sell these.
I think I'll stay away from that.
How original.
Please be a good treasure!
It's my buddy!
Sure, I could fish it out of there. But should I?
Poor little boat.
I think it's missing some parts.
Wonder what this is used for.
Looks like a part of something.
Seems like it was made with a purpose in mind.
Looks like I could use this.
You never know what you'll find under a rock.
It's a pile of dung.
Most definitely poop.
An electrifying discovery!
I'm heading out of here!
Careful, it's armed!
All that iron should be mine.
Not a leg to stand on.
Isn't it ironic?
Pool's gold.
Aw... it's hardly worth anything.
Science says it's gnad good.
It's a peaceful life.

Farm HouseQuarry Lodgings- 
I have no quarry with them.

Secret Bandit CampSecret Bandit Camp- 
Treasure!
A den of bloodsuckers.
Looks like an adventure to be had.
It looks... screamy.
This must be where those giant bugs live.
A few sticks or logs will brighten this up.
Looks like a headache.
It's an old wall.
I prefer fountains of knowledge.
Well that looks ominous.
Defying the laws of science.
That bursts my balloon.
A complete basket case.
I'll just leave that here.
I don't want to lug that luggage around.
I guess it raised some red flags.
It's been sandbagged.
Eggshell-ent
What eggsactly is that?
That makes me egg-stremely nervous.
Egg-sploded.
Busted and rusted.
Anyone home?
It's always a good idea to touch base.
We could make stuff with these.
He probably deserved it.
Soon, the invention will be complete!
I hope these don't hatch. Period.
This ought to be a scientific impossibility.
How in science did it get so big?!
It's too sticky to walk on.
Was that there before?
It's some sort of marble statue.
It looks old, but it feels new.
It's an odd marble statue.
It's not in the best shape.
There's a big piece missing.
I guess he cracked under the pressure.
All patched up.
Now what?
At least it's back in one piece now.
Something's moving inside.
Magmificent!
As gneiss a place as any.
Spooky.
Statuesque.
Don't lose your head now!
It's a fancy marble statue.
That rock came from the moon.
There's science inside!
I'm sure there's some scientific explanation for this.
It's all smashed up.
There's a hole in the middle for something to go in.
Now what?
The stone lit it up somehow.
I have a distinct feeling this isn't right.
I could probably break that.
It looks scared stiff.
Is there something in there?
%s must've died performing an experiment with %s.
Something's odd here, but I can't put my finger on it.
Just keep your hand to yourself, alright?
Where did this come from?
Where's the rest of it?
Is that a head?
It looks very lifelike.
I don't like how it's looking at me.
We should definitely open that.
Is that a mirage?
It's dry as a bone.
I think I can lift this one.
It's out of reach.
Aw, what a cute little starfish!
It tried to chomp me!
It's not fooling anyone now.
Hm? What did you say?
It wants to be finished.
It doesn't want to be on the ground.
I feel compelled to carry it somewhere.
It wants me to give it a home.
My brain pulses with peace and terror.
The cracks in this place are starting to show.
If only I could soak my weary bones.
Just a simple chemical reaction.
Water turns to glass under the moon. That's just science.
I'll just have to wait for it to fill up again.
There's something trapped inside.
I can practically see my reflection in it.
It's very sharp.
That's what they get for coming up on land.
It's a rock.
That's not a normal spider den.
Are those natural formations?
I guess it just grows like that.
It's mined... it's all mined!
Science compels me to lick it.
I made a compromise with wilderness.
I wonder if I could move that rock.
The earth itself rejects me!
I bet there's all sorts of things to discover down there.
I'll just stay down here, I suppose.
I've had enough discovery for now.
These used to grow in my bathroom.
A magic mushroom?
That mushroom got too big for its own good.
Science makes it glow.
It's strangely tasty looking.
Looks like a rock to me.
Rocks, rocks, rocks, rocks...
It's encrusted with old webbing.
A den of 'ew'.
Did that just move?
It's a fern.
Some leafy greens.
It's dubiously photosynthetical.
Not my fault!
Smells like a million giant bats.
It's holding up the roof.
I'll have to wait until someone leaves to enter.
The surface is too crowded!
I don't want to wake them.
I'm mildly offended by this.
It's trying to reproduce.
You can't tell from far away, but it's quite smelly.
The spiders thought this one was important.
Hasn't a care in the world.
That's a sight for spore eyes.
It's just drifting around.
I'll keep a little light in my pocket.
I don't think it got enough sun.
Seems safe to me.
Science bones! We should put them back together.
Still missing some pieces.
My scientific instincts say this isn't quite right.
It's alive! Oh wait, no, it's not.
It's not put together right.
It won't resurrect.
I wonder if I could move that rock.
I bet there's all sorts of things to discover down there.
It seems to throb out of tune with the world.
This seems to be broken.
An ancient and mysterious structure.
Some algae by a pond.
A pile of broken chess pieces.
Another pile of broken chess pieces.
Even more broken chess pieces.
Ancient household goods.
Nothing to work with here.
It's some smaller chunks of Thulecite.
Only a cyanobacteria could grow in this light.
It may contain something fantastic! Or horrible.
It may contain a bigger something fantastic! Or horrible.
I wonder what function this served.
I hear whispers. It wants something.
It's passing its judgment.
It didn't like that.
I guess I'm worthy.
The essential components are still intact.
It's gaining power.
Back in working order.
The gateway is destabilizing.
It needs time to recover. Me too.
I don't recognize any of these symbols.
Something must power it.
A truly unsettling light.
It depicts an old civilization. The people look hungry and scared.
This tablet is too worn to make out.
Something dark creeps over the city and its people.
The people are shedding their skins. They look different underneath.
It shows a massive, technologically advanced city.
It doesn't seem fully real.
I feel inspired.
This is a plant I could learn to love.
Maybe they'll grow back?
I think it needs to be fertilized.
Looks malnourished.
This belongs in the ground!
That cactus seems abnormally pokey.
Yikes! I could poke my eye out!
It'll sprout more pokers again some day.
A portable poker plant.
I'm glad I didn't step on this.
Blast it! It won't be mined!
It's a fire rock.
Would need an awfully big stocking...
You look ashen.
It's SPITacularly disgusting!
That seems like an excessive amount of locks.

Volcano AltarVolcano Altar of Snackrifice- 
It appears to be closed.
The altar is open and ready to accept offerings!
I can feel a cool breeze outside.
That pot looks smashing!
I wish it wasn't quite so striking.
I wonder what wonders hide in there?
Take that booby traps!
These ruins have been ruined.
I could probably sell that to one of those pigs.
It's holding up the roof.
Creepy creepers.
A few sticks or logs will brighten this up.
What are the probabilities of this working?
I should offer it something.
Looks scientifically apocalyptic.
Looks like it houses insects.
Takes its sweet time making honey.
Provides some light in an otherwise dark existence.
Don't hatch. Don't hatch. Don't hatch...
I should break that. For science.
Majestic.
Fancy enough to be behind glass.
I wouldn't want my boat to float away.
Not much left of it.
I should patch that up before we sink.
Avast! A mast!
Couldn't we have just made a lifeboat?
I could have been a sailor in another life.
These are floorboards.
It's surprisingly scratchy.
These are pretty snazzy.
Hastily cobbled stones.
Fungal red floor.
Green fungus-y turf.
A chunk of ground.
Yet another ground type.
Yet another ground type.
Dirty turf.
Sssstyle ssssstatement.
Very gnarled ground.
Meadow-y turf.
Lava-y floor.
Marsh-y floor.
Ashy turf.
Volcano-y turf.
It's a chunk of ground.
Some nicely cobbled together rocks.
You want proof it's fireproof?
A chunk of moon ground.
A chunk of beach.
Check it out!
Back off, preacherman!
Storm the castle!
It's a knightmare!
It's falling apart!
Terrifying!
What was that?!
OW! Something bit me!
You ain't nothing, hound dog!
That one is glowy.
Are there hounds for every season?
It's sharp!
I hate spiders.
Looks even meaner than usual.
I'd better not be here when he wakes up.
I should keep my distance.
Ewwww!
Good riddance!
It has a tangy, antiseptic smell.
It comes from a spider's butt.
He's going after my stuff!
Ew. It has Krampus slime all over it.
Smells fishy!
He's so cute!
Aww, look at him sleep!
He's croaked it.
That looks dangerous.
It's pointy and slimy.
I think these were its genitalia.
A slimy pole.
Yet another slimy pole.
Seems stinky, but worth exploring.
Little slippery arms.
He doesn't look as friendly as the others.
He's not friendly!
This offends me as a scientist.
Walruses are natural predators.
He won't be cute and cuddly forever.
I'm sure I'll find a use for it eventually.
It's covered with walrus hairs.
Disgusting little bloodsucker.
Hey, is that my blood?
It's probably not someone else's blood...
Aaah! Bug off!
Gah! More spiders!
I hate spiders!
Ack! That's terrifying!
It's so alluring.
Now I can start my very own meat farm.
I think I'm being watched.
It's so hairy!
Doesn't look much different dead.
Note to self: Don't look up.
It's a worm!
Seems safe to me.
Just looks like a pile of dirt.
What a crusty looking animal.
Scratchy metal fibers.
You might be something to reckon with, big dog.
It looks unhappy about me stealing those Birchnuts!
Take that, nature!
A mad little nut.
I'd rather stay away from the business end of that jerk.
That looks like an experiment gone wrong.
It's a dog-eat-me world out here.
Get off the water you maniac!
Leave me alone!
Eye see.
He met a terrible end. I will too if I don't get out of here.
These blasted mosquitoes carry a terrible sickness.
Part of a yellow mosquito.
I wonder if it'll sell me some oil?
Even worse than a common snake!
I'm intrigued AND repelled.
Looks even meaner than usual.
I should keep my distance.
Good riddance!
These things sure are persistent.
I think I'll keep my distance.
I think this fish evolved to run me through.
Looks like a fighter.
I think bloating has begun...
You're a quick one, aren't you?
Scientifically impossible.
I'm not going anywhere near that!
Better gnat go near those guys.
Always hanging around.
I don't like the look of him.
Swindling swine.
A shadowy chapeau.
A map to where that thief hid all his treasure!
A pernicious amphibian.
Looks deranged.
That better not be poisonous.
Plants shouldn't move! That's just science!
Science could not have done this.
That thing is rather large!
I don't want to wake it.
That's that.
I'd prefer to keep all of my blood.
Hopefully it won't get up again.
I feel a bit safer.
Is the bat hide hiding in there?
Agh! Stay away!
Whee!
I'll be careful with this carapace.
That presence... it's familiar! Hello?
Looks serious.
It's probably someone else's blood...
It's being controlled by that beast!
It's guarding the queen.
Too hot to handle.
The smell is not the most pleasant.
I think we're safe now.
Science save us!
Science save us!
I have a very strong desire to run.
Now I can breathe easy.
That thing's terrifying!
Thank goodness. It's sleeping.
That's the end of that.
Oh good. The moon mutated it.
Thank science, it stopped moving.
Is it really dead?
It's a beefalo!
He's coming along peacefully.
These guys are really heavy sleepers.
Aww, he's so sad.
This one is slightly less smelly than the others.
Hmmm, there may be too much food inside it.
This fellow appears quite ridable.
It looks deeply angry.
It smells like beefalo tears.
It sounds like a beefalo field in there.
Awwww. So cute!
He's watching me.
To bee or not to bee.
Oh no! It's a killer bee!
Careful!
This seems dangerous.
Looks sharp!
They kind of creep me out.
He's part of my entourage.
Someone should tell his family.
It still has the tail on it.
I am filled with an irresistible urge to do science.
I just like holding it.
Adorably delicious.
It looks warm and full of meat.
Must be breeding season.
It has terrifying claws.
Ew. Just ew.
He's less gross, but still gross.
If it wasn't useful, I wouldn't touch it.
A puzzle with no solution.
I hope it doesn't mess up my hair.
It sticks to my back.
Curious little guy.
What a bizarre buzzard!
A playful little thing.
I think it's still swishing.
'Baaaah' yourself!
I don't think it liked being struck by lightning.
It's like a miniature lightning rod.
This whale has emotional issues.
Gross. I think the bloating has begun.
Such a round, rubbery fellow.
Guess that house is FINished.
Science works in mysterious, blobby ways.
Now this creature is pure science!
These creatures seem reasonable.
I grabbed the ox by the horn.
Those things are going to be the end of me.
Looks aggressive.
Large and screamy.
Large and pointy-headed.
This ought to be of some use.
What a huge bug!
An bug at rest will stay at rest.
Exterminated.
A spinny spiny sort.
It's boring.
Science says it's always hungry.
Please don't arrest me.
Sweet dreams, smelly.
You're part of my entourage.
Someone should tell its family.
I feel a lil better when I hold one.
That would mess up my hair.
It sticks to your back when you wear it.
It's cute, but it's not ripe yet.
I think it's ripe now.
It's snoozing.
Butterfly, flutter by.
Now I have you!
Creepy!
He's not very happy in there.
Does that mean spring is coming?
He likes my pocket.
Life in the frozen wastes.
It's so soft.
A crow feather.
A redbird feather.
A snowbird feather.
Stupid bird! Stay away from my berries!
It's looking at me.
It went to sleep.
The eyebone was consumed by fire when I teleported!
Otto von Chesterfield, Esq.
He's looking for carrots.
Do you like science?
If only I could catch them!
They make my pocket glow!
I've heard strange things about those plants.
Stop following me!
Mandrake roots have strange properties.
Poor little guy.
Ugh, my head!
Does that mean winter is gone?
It's cute, in a gross kind of way.
The petals shimmer in the light.
The petals droop and shimmer in the light.
The flower was consumed by fire when I teleported!
These would look awesome on a helmet!
This goop smells foul.
Something's under there, searching for minerals.
I'd sure like to whack that mole... thing.
Nowhere left to dig, my friend.
These make a soothing glow.
Don't get snappy with me, mister.
I wonder where that crabbit went?
It has that wet-dog smell.
You have got to be kitten me.
Looks like something I want to carry around.
All that's left after the fire has done its job.
I bet I could pack'im full of stuff.
A colorful blob of science.
That's a lot of tendrils.
I find myself fresh out of crackers.
I try not to eat anything with a name.
Shoo! Find some other land!
Shoo! Find some other water!
I tou-can't catch him.
I bet it eats a lot of fish.
I feel oddly protective of this dumb bird.
It's for doydoy eggs, dummy.
Soft AND endangered!
Maybe I should have let it hatch.
Oh well. I'm sure there are lots more!
A controlled chemical reaction has made this egg matter more nutritious.
What a cute little... thing.

Teen DoydoyTeen Doydoy (held)- 

WobsterWobster- 
What a Wascally Wobster.
You better not try anything fishy.
The Money Man.
Working Banker's hours I see.

I hope he doesn't farm pigs.
Dreaming of manure.

Garden variety villager.
Wouldn't she prefer a flower bed?

Pig HatmakerHatmaker- 
Hats off to you, hatmaker.
A tip of the hat to anyone able to sleep so soundly.

Pig HunterHunter- 
Do you have killing implements available here?
Killing time.

Pig MayorMayor Truffleston- 
I didn't vote for him.
Typical. Sleeping on the job.

That can't be comfortable.

Pig UsherUsher- 
Likes the sweet stuff.
He's sleeping.

Pig WorkerWorker- 
Mr. Fix-it.
Taking a rest.

KingfisherKingfisher (normal and held)- 
What a pointy bill!
In a slumber.
Perished.
An azure bird.
It's just resting.
An ex-parrot.
It's only carrying a couple diseases.
It's fast asleep.
It has passed.
She's on a roll.
She needs to get her dung together.
She's pooped.
Dung for.
A light aflight.
You're not getting my gold.
That bush is alive!
Look! An iris bush.
It's getting some shut-eye.
Dead-eyed.
Still blinking.
He's a bit of a nut job.
Probably dreaming of trees.
I feel kinda bad.
For some reason I'm craving tea.
A shocking sight!
My current favorite.
Stupid bird! Stay away from those berries!
The eyebone was consumed by fire in the teleportation!
Cut it out!
It doesn't seem so strange anymore.
The flower was consumed by fire in the teleportation!
These would look empirically amazing on a helmet!
It's an extra leafy lizard.
I always wanted one of these.
Maybe he needs some science?
Hutch Danglefish, P.I.
Some sort of yellow creature made of science.
I'm not squishing you, am I?
It's probably fine.
A canary feather.
Aww. Who's a good monster?
It seems happy.
I hear a tiny stomach grumbling.
Poor thing must be starving.
There's a faint warmth coming from inside.
I never thought I would see a happy egg.
I don't think that egg is warm enough.
It's an egg tooth!
Cooled off and chilled out.
Is it staring at me? ...No, I guess not.
What an impressive antler!
Was that supposed to come off?
I've never seen a live puffin before!
Catching one ain't puffin to brag about.
Peacefully huffin' and puffin'.
Are carrots supposed to have legs?
You're kind of ugly up close.
It's almost cute.
That's the end of that.
My vast scientific knowledge tells me... It's a moon butterfly.
I've got you now.
That's a tall bird!
That's quite an egg.
The nest is empty.
Will it hatch?
Delicious and nutritional.
Looks like it's hatching.
Mmm. Beaky.
Are eggs supposed to sweat?
Brrrr!
I have a feeling this is going to take a while...
It should hatch any time now.
That's a rather small bird.
It looks hungry.
It must be starving.
Not a very tall bird.
I'd better find it some food.
It has a dangerous look in its eye.
Ow! Quit it!
That's quite an egg!
Is it shivering or am I?
You need some food and quick, huh?
He's huge!
AHHHHHHHH! That spider is huge!
I hope I got all of the spider goo out of it.
It's enormous!!
This is really gross.
That thing doesn't look happy.
Wow! I'm glad that didn't gore me!
What a bear of a badger.
A mat of thick fur.
I don't exactly know what that thing is.
Its contents are like excited electrons trying to escape.
Aaah! You are definitely not an electron!
Fluffy!
That's one fly dragon!
They're still warm.
Hot spit!
I like to call it 'Basaliva'.
Someone gimme a hand with this palm!
Now's not the time for me to be Quacken wise!
A beast that never sleeps.
To the victor, the spoils.
I'd say I made the pecking order around here quite clear.
I thought it was oddly windy around here.

SealSealnado (seal form)- 
D'awww.
Perhaps this powered the fury of that beastly storm?
This is a powerful artifact.
Well that's terrifying.
More eyes means better sight... right?
I wish I had gills.
Scientifically speaking, it shouldn't exist.
Ha ha, snake. I have your bone.
Petrifying.
A numbskull.
The Queen regn-ant.
Don't mess up my hair, crown.
Metaphisical end-ity.
I hope he doesn't want this back.
I regret causing that.
Metal touched with science.
It puts its babies there.
Keep that stinger away from me!
The world seems less a little crazy when I wear it.
What on earth is that thing!
Its chains came off!
It's really fancy for a deer antler.
That toadstool's just asking to be cut down.
Just a hole in the ground.
There's something poking out.
Yeesh! I'm not kissing that!
He's hopping mad now!
How scientific!
A mushroom cloud in the making!
Warts and all!
The skeleton fused with the shadows!
Sharp! Sharp bones!!
It's shielded!
Anklebiters!
No bones about it.
It gives me terrible visions.
It smells like chemicals.
It's been thuribly depleted.
I hate that guy.
Ewwww, he smells!
Maxwell's statues are trapping him.
Awww, she has a cute little bow.
That is one biiig foot.
He looks kind of regal.
I'm a sucker for this guy.
I already don't like that guy.
Three heads are better than one.
A leg up.
The tail end.
It wants something from me.
I think we're on good terms.
It looks mad.
A mini departiculator.
A more sane person would walk.
I could've been skewered!
It's so gritty!
Memories of the time I wasn't skewered.
That's science for you.
They're promising me... knowledge.
Stars and atoms! Are you my doppelgänger, %s?
Yeesh. Do I always look that creepy?
Your existence is an affront to the laws of science, %s!
%s has expertly put our theories into practice.
Better concoct a revival device. Can't leave another man of science floating.
Burning that wasn't very scientific, %s.
Good day to you, %s!
%s is holding that lighter pretty tightly...
Murderer! Arsonist!
%s, friend of ghosts.
I bet you're just burning for a heart, %s.
Again?
It's good to see you, %s!
Let's not start a fight with the strongman...
Murderer! I can take you!
%s is just a big teddy bear.
I told you you couldn't deadlift that boulder, %s. The numbers were all wrong.
You can't actually 'fight' fire, %s!
Greetings, %s!
%s doesn't have any sharp objects, does she?
Murderer!
%s treats ghosts like family.
I'm seeing double! I'd better concoct a heart for %s.
I know you set those flames, %s.
Good day to you, %s!
I think we need to tweak your primary directive, %s...
%s! You've violated the first law!
I guess %s got that empathy module up and running.
I always thought %s could use a heart. Now I'm certain!
You look like you're gonna melt, %s. What happened?
Good day, %s!
I think %s's planning to throw the book at me.
Here comes my peer review!
I have deep respect for %s's practical theorems.
This doesn't seem very scientific, does it, %s?
I'm sure you had a very clever reason for that fire.
Greetings, %s!
%s has been a bit of a sap lately...
Murder! Bring me an axe and we'll get in the swing of things!
%s saved everyone's backbacon.
Does 'universal' coverage include the void, %s?
%s's gone on a wood chucking rampage!
Will you bea-very mad if I don't revive you, %s?
Gad-zooks, that's a moose!
That moose'nt be very comfortable.
Take a gander at that!
Be more careful, you silly goose!
Don't burn yourself out, %s.
Greetings, %s!
%s is silent, but deadly...
Mime this!
%s thinks outside the invisible box.
How do you say 'I'll conduct a revival device' in mime?
Wait, don't tell me. You lit a fire.
Decent day to you, %s!
Seems you've gone from 'dapper' to 'slapper'.
I'll show you Logic and Reason... those're my fists!
%s is using his powers for good.
Don't look at me like that, %s! I'm working on it!
%s's just asking to get roasted.
Good day, %s!
I'd like to avoid a punch from %s, if possible.
%s's gone berserk!
%s has full command of spirits.
Nice try. You're not escaping to Valhalla yet, %s.
%s is really heating things up today.
Good day, %s!
I'm gonna roll up a piece of papyrus newspaper, just in case.
Murderer! I'll squash you, %s!
%s is playing well with others.
%s is really buggin' me for a heart.
We need to have a group meeting about fire safety.
Good day to you, %s!
%s is a safety hazard.
It ends here, %s!
It's pretty handy having you around, %s.
That probably threw a wrench into her plans.
Things are burning up at the factory today.
Greetings to you, %s!
I knew %s couldn't be trusted!
Time to grab the imp by the horns!
Thanks for lending a helping claw, %s.
I reject the reality of ghosts and imps.
%s is becoming a survival liability.
Greetings, %s!
%s seems pricklier than usual today.
Prepare to get weed whacked, %s!
%s never gives up on his friends.
You need some help, lil guy?
I thought you hated fire, %s.
Greetings, %s!
Well, this is a recipe for disaster.
I hope you don't have any half-baked plans to murder me!
Always rely on %s to cook up a plan.
Maybe he was cooking with ghost peppers.
He's gonna flambé the place right down!
Good day, %s!
%s is looking especially monstrous today...
You're just another murderous merm!
Why thank you, %s!
%s is looking greener around the gills than usual.
Didn't anyone teach you not to play with fire?!
Greetings, %s!
%s looks shifty...
Murderer!
%s, friend of ghosts.
%s could use a heart.
Burning that wasn't very scientific, %s.
A small, normal egg.
Sunny side yum!
It's a bit gamey, but it'll do.
Char broiled to perfection.
Just jerky enough.
A tiny chunk of dead animal.
Now I don't have to worry about getting worms!
A little jerky.
Ugh. I don't think I should eat that.
That's only somewhat more appetizing than when it was raw.
Strange-smelling jerky.
That doesn't look very appealing.
At least it's warm now.
I should gobble it.
Now it's even tastier.
Now I shall eat for a day.
Grilled to perfection.
This will make a delicious meal.
Smells great!
A light breezy trunk.
A thick, hairy trunk.
Somehow even more nasal than before.
I've heard it's a delicacy.
Tastes like chicken.
I hate these things, even when they're dead.
At least it's not coming back.
Good dog.
I better not run with this.
What a tropical looking fish.
It lived a good life. Maybe.
It's all wriggly.
An electric shock will not revive it. I tried.
A colorful snack!
I'd be a jerk not to eat this.
A chunk of fish meat.
Where did this can come from?
Grilled to perfection.
A small bit of fish.
A small bit of cooked fish.
Limpets Bizkets.
Escargotcha!
Could use some flexing.
I cook a mean mussel.
Fish babies.
Roe, sunny side up.
It looks like a fish, but it feels clammy.
Fried fry.
This one's extra water repellent.
Gilled to perfection.
Surf and turf, hold the turf.
That fish is fin-ished.
A sleek fin.
You should cook up nicely.
I can't wait to eat you.
I'm not dissecting that.
Where the dragoon once stored its feelings.
Looks noxious.
Tainted fricassee.
Small and gelatinous.
I have to be pretty desperate for food.
Now there's no reason to worry about getting worms!
Ready for gobbling.
Even better for gobbling!
I hate those things, even when they're dead.
Looks like the runt of its school.
I won't win any bragging rights with this one.
It's a bit on the small side.
A fish this size won't tide me over for long.
I can't wait to pop it in my mouth.
I certainly hope it tastes better than it looks.
I went to a lot of treble to catch it.
I wasn't lion about my aptitude for fishing!
I'm sure this won't bring me any bad luck.
This one seems kind of corny.
Red berries taste the best.
I don't think heat improved them.
It's mushy.
Yum!
What a weird fruit.
Still weird.
Oh, it smells!
Now it smells even worse!
It looks like the inside of an alien's brain.
Haute Cuisine!
Sticky sweet.
Juicy and warm.
It's mushy.
Yum!
It requires a large nut hacker.
When I click them together, they make horsey sounds!
Now I just need a cake.
They could use some roasting.
Heat definitely improved them.
The fruit's still weird.
Extra tasty, though they won't last long.
Better eat them before they spoil!
Yuck. It's all vegetabley.
Mushy.
High in fructose!
It doesn't look like an egg.
It's even less eggy.
It's as big as my head!
How did it not turn into a pie?
It smells funny.
It seems pretty normal.
It's weird and gooey.
It's different now...
Looks delicious.
Nutritious, but it won't last long.
There are still some spines between me and a tasty meal.
Grilled fruit of the desert.
A pretty flower from a prickly plant.
A weed. Of the sea.
Crispy.
Salty!
That's an odd looking carrot.
Looks yammy!
Looks even yammier!
Scientifical and nutritional.
I cooked it!
A vegetable.
Science says it's good for me.
Beans. With legs.
I'm sure it tastes better than it looks.
A lovely science flower.
A delicacy.
Science says the sharp edges are good for my lungs.
It looks radishing.
I wonder if this makes it tastes better.
Too bad tuber.
I wonder if it's still poisonous?
It's a blooming tuber!
Did I cook the flower too?
Yuck. This vegetable came out of the dirt.
Cooked and high in fructose!
Kinda wrinkled.
It gets my pockets all wet and gross.
It's closer to a liquid than a solid.
Kind of high sodium content.
I'd shatter my teeth on that.
Uncooked stone fruit is the pits.
It's actually soft enough to eat now.
The number one breath enhancer.
Perfectly browned.
Looks crunchy.
A successful chemical reaction.
Nice and spicy.
It was already hot to begin with.
The apples of the earth.
A successful temperature experiment.
It's red because it's full of science.
Cooking's easy if you understand chemistry.
The perfect breakfast for a man of science.
I threw the recipe away and just kind of winged it.
The dragonfruit is very filling.
Sticks to my ribs.
Crunchy and delicious!
I probably should have made a jar.
A very leggy sandwich.
Fruity.
Sweet and savory.
Tastes like chicken, but I don't think it is.
Lunch on a stick.
Well, he won't be waking up again.
I cooked it myself!
A stew to put some meat on my bones.
It's an affront to science.
These turned out pretty good.
I don't know if I'm hungry enough.
That's a pretty gourd cookie!
An excellent source of fiber.
I'll be stuffed after eating this!
My dentist'd get mad if I ate this... but I don't have one.
Mmmm.
I hope this doesn't make me feel eel!
I'm waffling on whether I should add more syrup.
It tastes like nothing.
A bowl of foliage.
Avogadro's favorite dish.
I scream for ice cream!
Cryogenic watermelon.
Five alarm!
A healthy, natural snack.
No, not brain freeze! I need that for science!
Cooking that sure kept me bisque-y!
But I don't have chopsticks.
Can I get a bigger bowl? This one looks a little shrimpy.
Smells delicious and energizing!
Jelly-O pop it right in my mouth!
Could use more salt, but that's none of my bisque-ness.
If I eat it in the morning is it still dinner?
It's a jumbo seafood gumbo.
It's shark fin-ished!
It's perf!
Sugary fruit! Part of a balanced breakfast.
There's got to be something else to eat around here.
Imagine the experiments I could run on it!
Sweet potato souffles are a rising trend.
I never had it before I came here.
I seasoned it with a dash of science.
Smells like it tastes.
With refried rock dwellers.
Chewy and confectionary.
I'm going to pretend I don't know what's in it.
I scream for iced tea.
Innocuous inoculation.
The best way to serve snake.
Can you use the celery as a straw?
Science says it's a hamburger.
Tea time!
We threw the recipe away and just kind of winged it.
Sticks to your ribs.
Probably should have made a jar.
It's just a big wad of meat.
A stew to put some meat on your bones.
Science help us.
It's really stuffing!
If I had a dentist they'd be mad I ate stuff like that.
I hope this doesn't make anyone eel!
I'm waffling on whether it needs more syrup.
One part jelly, one part bean.
No bones about it, Warly can cook.
I hope I can handle the spice level.
Is that just... frogs stuffed inside a fish?
How in science does it taste so good?
Warly sure can cook.
I've heard cooking is basically chemistry. I should try it.
He's as talented a chef as I am a scientist.
It's a little spooky.
What a mouthful!
I forgot what good food tasted like.
Potato, scientifically infused with the power of a tornado!
So... hot...!
It's shockingly delicious.
Each one is a tiny mystery.
It's a carrot seed.
It's a corn seed.
It's a weird fruit seed.
It's a durian seed.
It's an eggplant seed.
It's a pome-whatsit seed.
It's a pumpkin seed.
I cooked all the life out of 'em!
Looks delicious!
Without these, it's just a butter.
I can't believe it's butter!
It's a furry ball of rotten food.
Ew! It stinks!
It's thick and pliable. And salty.
Roasted to perfection.
It's buzzing with tastiness!
It's a melon seed.
Squishy.
Food for thought.
My very own plant eggs.
Evidence of my hard labor.
Take that, tiny tree!
I bet I could find a use for it.
I could use this to make honey.
Water you think it does?
It's an aloe seed.
It's asparagus seeds.
It's a radish seed.

Don't Starve Together
Toasted SeedsToasted Seeds- 
That cooked the life right out of 'em!
It infuses the eater with the power of science!
A handful of odd seeds.
A handful of odd seeds.
A handful of seeds.
A handful of odd seeds.
A handful of odd seeds.
It's scientific!
A pile of mechanical parts.
All that's left after fire has done its job.
There's a perfectly scientific explanation for that.
It sparkles with inner warmth.
It sparkles with cold energy.
This gem is yellow.
It's green and gemmy.
It's an orange gem.
I made them with my face.
I should fill my pockets!
Another flavor of poop.
They are all melted together.
It's just a cheap replica.
The knot is stuck. Forever.
It must be some kind of religious artifact.
Sadly, it's too small for me to escape on.
Their electricity carrying days are over.
I have no time for fun and games!
Great. All of my tub stopping needs are met.
I'm more of a zipper person, myself.
I hope I get out of here before I need these.
He whispers beautiful lies to me.
I'm not sure what I should do with a dessicated tentacle.
That seems really dangerous.
Poor little guy. He deserves a proper funeral.
Bits of bone.
There's SCIENCE afoot!
Only poison can cure poison.
I'm rich!
Chilling.
Someone wrote me a note!
I'm not terribly curious about the smell.
The label says 'Jay's Wondrous Snake Oil!'
I don't intend to harp on the issue.
I wonder how old this artifact is?
I can perform amputations if anyone'd like to wear it for real.
What is this substance?
This thing gives me the creeps...
Incredible! This guitar has undergone shrinkification!
How did this get all the way out here?
A relic of a bygone era!
Clouding of the brain... never heard of it...
I'm sure someone would like this.
Someone lost their words.
I wonder where the false one is?
Where's the other one?
An instrument of some sort.
I ought to measure it to make sure it's to scale.
Looks kinda soggy.
Scientific!
That's a key.
Something somewhere must be locked.
This key probably unlocks something.
It's oddly monkey-sized.
It's gotta be worth something.
I'm rich!
A coin worth my gentlemanly stature.
For hammering out the details.
A priceless piece of history.
The relic of an ancient culture.
Looks valuable.
A regal relic.
It's an old fancy feast.
A nasaltelepathical bug communicator.
Ahoy there, alloy!
Bug coating.
Perfect for a gentleman scientist.
At last a home for my science.
It must have scientifical properties.
Royal-key.
City engineering isn't a real science.
Maybe I can trade it for something.
Says 
Comedy in a can.
It's only gross when they're not your own.
Melted. Maybe Willow had some fun with them?
What's kazoo with you?
There's no time for fun and games!
They've quickly become Wes' favorite prop.
Hal whispers beautiful lies to me.
That's just asking to be experimented on.
It's hauntingly beautiful.
It hurts my soul to look at that thing.
It's giving me the creeps.
Something is up with that flower!
I don't know if I should hang on to this.
I'd die to find out what it does.
It's a prettier axe than I'm used to.
It looks like clown currency.
How are they floating?
Spooky.
It's REALLY scientific!
Black and white fur.
A picture of a sculpture. We'll need somewhere to make it.
A picture of some fishing tackle. I bet I could make this...
There is power emanating from it.
The power of science must have reanimated it...
It must be some kind of religious artifact.
Now if I only had some tea...
...Maxwell left his stuff out again.
A horrifyingly failed utensil fusion. I guess science *can* go too far.
I wonder what it's hiding?
It doesn't spin very well.
Wigfrid keeps jumping out and hitting me with it?!
This egg beater is all bent out of shape.
I have a few theories about this string.
I can put my shoes on without help, thanks.
Honestly, he just leaves them out wherever.
I think Wickerbottom had a cat.
It smells kind of stale.
Food and a cup! The ultimate survival container.
How Machiavellian.
If you unwound it you could poke someone from really far away.
It's always smart to keep an eye out.
That'll keep a watchful eye on the place.
It can see and be seen for miles!
No one could get lost with that thing looking out for them.
Makes a good marker, but I wish it'd stop looking at me.
That ought to show everyone the way.
This gem seems special.
It's scientifically proven that gems look better on top of sticks.
Brr! Chilling.
Someone might be interested in this.
This package is barely holding together.
That didn't go well. I'll have to try again.

AshesAshes of Thing- 

Divining RodDivining Rod (before picked up from its starting base)- 
That rod looks useful!
It's some kind of homing device.
The signal is very faint.
I'm headed in the right direction.
I must be getting pretty close.
This thing's going crazy!
I wonder what it does.
It looks like it needs a large key.
Now my machine can work!
I'm not sure I want to fall for that a second time.
So that's where the music was coming from.
I wonder how they work.
It really captures his personality.
I'll want to avoid stepping on that!
Oops.
Guh, that thing looks worse off than usual.
Looks almost like a key hole.
That doesn't look very comfortable.
He's trapped!
She's trapped!
It's trapped!
Now the machine can work!
He's a lot shorter in person.
It's a... thing.
I'm free! I'm finally free!
So cold!
Go for the eyes!
I will destroy you!
Here piggy piggy!
I'm going to stomp you dead!
Better you than me!
I sure showed him!
He's too fast!
I'll let him go. This time.
He's too gross anyway.
Shoo, you nasty thing!
BEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!
It's getting late. It will be dark soon.
It's so dark!
I can see again!
It's too dark to see!
I can't do that.
I don't have all the ingredients.
That doesn't go there.
It's too bright out.
I'm not tired.
I'm too hungry to sleep, the growling will keep me up!
It's too dangerous right now!
I'll try again in a second.
Maybe I'll just hold on to this.
Too unconscious to care.
Are you still hungry, plant?
Did you hear that?
Did you feel that?
That sounded big!
I can't carry any more stuff!
It's full.
That can't go in there.
I can't cook right now.
It's too far away!
I can't shave that!
There isn't even any stubble left!
I'm not going to try that while he's awake.
I think it's fine as is.
I know better than to bother an angry beefalo!
It won't let me do that while it's angry.
I can't place that from way up here.
Yum!
I think that was starting to turn.
Yuck! That was terrible!
I don't feel so good.
I'm so hungry!
Oops.
My light just ran out!
Ow!
I think I can fix this!
That doesn't sound good.
Safe from that frightening lightning!
Need... ice... or... shade!
Thanks for protection from the elements, tree!
Oh, H2O.
My clothes appear to be permeable.
Water way to go!
I've nearly reached my saturation point.
Wow that tool is slippery!
That thing is about to catch fire.
Yikes! That was hot!
That sounded big!
I don't exactly have a burning desire to sleep in that.
That doesn't sound good.
That can't be good.
I'm going to need a bigger boat...
Did you hear that?
That sounded big!
Here there be monsters.
It would seem my future is foggy.
I think I felt something brush against my leg...
Weeeee!
I need to get to land!
I think I sprung a leak.
I seem to be sinking.
My net filled up!
I could've sworn it was right there...
This seems to point to points unknown.

Can't buy item (not enough money)- 
I can't pay for that.
It's locked.
My house is in the Hamlet, not here.
Cough! Cough!
This {item} is too hot.
My nose feels.. itchy.
I don't want to claw my eyes out anymore.
For Science!
AHHH CHOOOO!
I don't like the look of this.
I'm too hungry to sleep, my growling tummy will keep me up!
I'm too scared of dying to sleep right now!
I've already got a pet.
All the monsters came back!
Die, doe!
oOooOooo!!
This beast seems to be wounded.
Someone beat me to the saddle!
We're taking on a lot of water.
I don't want to drown!
I already know that one.
I can't learn that one.
This map was made for some other place.
I need to see the moon for that to work.
Someone beat me to it.
It won't fit.
I need something to build with.
Whoops! Wrong plans.
Looks like we had the same idea.
They're elbow deep in junk right now.
I should wait my turn.
I'm not a fancy enough chef for that.
There's only room for one scribbler.
I don't think that was right.
It's not quite the right shape.
The ceiling is destabilizing!
This compass doesn't point anymore.
Now's not the time to flee this fight!
I can see the light!
It was worth a shot.
Perhaps this is a bad idea.
I wonder who set that flare?
My humanity is about to start slipping away...
I don't feel well enough.
There's no way to beat it now!!
It called for help!
Whoops! That wasn't right.
I'm a little preoccupied!!
I'm not sure that was science.
There's a form trapped inside.
I've almost got it out.
You're free!
A living log would probably be of more use.
A mushroom would probably be of more use.
I'm not sticking that in there!
This gem won't work here.
Uh, is it supposed to smell like that?
It looks better already.
I can't eat that!
Putting that in my mouth would be disgusting!
Did I just hear trees screaming?
I'll try again in a second.
Maybe I'll just hold on to this.
Your pockets are too full!
Too unconscious to care.
I can't open presents with monsters about!
I should get off my beefalo first.
That would be a waste of a bath bomb.
I can't, the surface is glassed over.
I can't change while it's on fire!
I'm wet, but alive.
My fan has gone with the wind.
I feel so accomplished!
If only my friends could see me now...
I hate parties.
There is a scientific solution, here. I know it.
Mwahahaha!
I'm sure I had a scientific reason for this.
This may prove to be my most dangerous experiment yet.
I've the brains AND the brawn.
Perhaps I'll retire to a life of rose breeding.
Brrrrr!
Oh yes, I'm cooking something up.
The root of all malady lies in an imbalance of the humors.
Stand back. I'm going to do SCIENCE!
Obsidious.
I can see into his pores.
I'm not sure if I want to open it.
Why did I even make a pitchfork this fancy?
Is that how I got here?
Someone must live here.
It's no use to me out there!
It's almost like someone is trying to prevent me from going somewhere.
Smells like bacon.
A chunk of ground.
It's probably a tuft of grass.
A crusted over lava pit.
Nice and comfy.
The lava's crusting over.
Looks fragile.
Bottled mosquito rage!
Aaah! Bug off!
How convenient!
Well, that was easy.
It doesn't look finished! It could be dangerous.
OW! I don't think it's ready yet.
It smells of bacon!
I'm not strong enough to wield it.
Just bits and pieces of rock.
I find the shards get in my food.
Ow!
Oh good. Now there's more of him.
If I had any friends, this could take me to them.
If I step through, will I still be me?
It seems to be popular over there.
Produces a lot of heat, but not much light.
Is it winking at me?
I don't think it's supposed to look like that.

Gone to seed.
I think someone planted this on me.
A little seedy.
A mixed bag.
A packet packed with seeds.
It has a lot on its plate.
Well bowl me over.
Soup's on!
This should tide me over.
That's what all the wheat is for.
I've masta-d this pasta.
Full of fresh vegetables.
I'm pro-protein.
Science says fatty acids are good for me.
Not as crabby as I thought.
Cheese it!
This dessert won't desert you.
It looks meaner than usual.
Nothing more than a dressed up thief.
Yikes!
Yikes! Get me back to land!
Will it grow again?
One day it may return.
Farewell, sweet plant.
It's a coffee maker.
The quintessential pirate sail.

Am I still in one piece?
It's for me to put my stuff in.
It's better to sleep.
I can sleep in here when I'm hurt.
I get crazy when I don't sleep.
I could heat this up near the fire.
It's stone cold.
It's warm and cuddly... for a rock!
Nice and toasty hot!
A most potent dish.
It doesn't look finished. It could be dangerous!
Ow! I don't think it's finished yet!
This science is now out of control!
What a nice hat.
There was someone here before me!
Such a touching stone.
Better him than me!
I wonder if that rock could be moved.
It's probably hiding something.
Did that just move?
Good thing it's contained!
What a nasty little blood sucker.
A monkey with little brain.
It's a seed.
It's getting late. I need to make a fire.
I feel so smart now!
Never stop learning!
I didn't learn very much from that.
In you go!
Poooop!
Let me axe you a question!
I will unlock the secrets of ... grass.
I can learn stuff by reeding!
This probably isn't the best use of flint.
There must be science hiding somewhere in there.
Now I should build it!
My torch just ran out!
Go to good world of dreams little beefalo.
I wouldn't want to pick a bone with the owner.
The trail ends here.
It might be okay if it was cooler.
Poor guy. I should put him to rest.
It's a seed.
This should keep the water out.
I see no possible downsides to using this.
And so I sail away into the horizon...
That is a large nut.
It requires a large nut hacker.
I can't see the bottom!
That seems safe.
It's broken.
I think bloating has begun...
I wonder where that crab went?
He seems open to trading.
Maybe starving wouldn't be so bad...
Surf's up!
This map doesn't correlate to my current surroundings.
Oh, the science I could get up to with this!
Poison tipped.
Fire tipped.
These blasted mosquitos carry a sickness.
What a show-off.
These guys again.
Let's see if we can come to an arrangement.
Should let me mount some smelly animal.
I can take the saddle off now.
I seem to have discovered a cure!
This is why we can't have nice things.
Maybe I can be even more handsome!
So long, style.
For making some much needed repairs.
At least I won't die of boredom.
I might die of boredom.
Something's coming!!
Huh. It looks kinda like a key.
Don't poison me, please!
It's on a road to nowhere.
Someone beat that clock.
A baby barbecue.
Laboratory tools for butchery.
I can put a good meal together in a pinch.
It's good if you don't think about where it came from.
For drowning desserts in.
I need more than a penny for my thoughts.
Feels less than a pound.
It looks sick. More so than usual.
It's rickety, but it appears to function. After a fashion...
Uh, is it supposed to smell like that?
It looks pretty sick.
Is it staring at me? ...No, maybe not.
Why'd it have to be so big?
Is that a mirror?
It's Wilson!
Stars and atoms! It's %s!
That Wilson looks shifty...
Murderer!
Wilson, friend of ghosts.
Wilson could use a heart.
Better concoct a revival device. Can't leave a fellow scientist floating.
It's Willow!
That Willow looks shifty...
Murderer!
Willow, friend of ghosts.
Willow could use a heart.
It's Wolfgang!
That Wolfgang looks shifty...
Murderer!
Wolfgang, friend of ghosts.
%s, friend of ghosts.
Wolfgang could use a heart.
It's Wendy!
That Wendy looks shifty...
Murderer!
Wendy, friend of ghosts.
%s, friend of ghosts.
Wendy could use a heart.
I'm seeing double! I'd better concoct a revival device.
It's WX-78!
That WX-78 looks shifty...
Murderer!
You've violated the first law!
WX-78, friend of ghosts.
Looks like %s got that empathy module up and running.
WX-78 could use a heart.
It's Wickerbottom!
That Wickerbottom looks shifty...
I think she's planning to throw the book at me.
Murderer!
Wickerbottom, friend of ghosts.
Wickerbottom could use a heart.
It's Woodie!
Good day, %s!
That Woodie looks shifty...
Murderer!
Woodie, friend of ghosts.
Woodie could use a heart.
It's Wes!
That Wes looks shifty...
Murderer!
Wes, friend of ghosts.
Wes could use a heart.
It's Maxwell!
That Maxwell looks shifty...
Murderer!
Maxwell, friend of ghosts.
Maxwell could use a heart.
She's gone berserk!
It's %s!
Flesh is flesh. Where do I draw the line?
Cooked nice and pink, but still morally gray.
Letting it dry makes it not come from a human, right?
Melted. Did the arsonist have a go at these?
They've quickly become the mime's favorite prop.
It's hauntingly beautiful.
It's not the weirdest thing I've seen...
I'm dying to find out what it does.
The magician left his stuff out again.
Maxwell left his stuff out again.
Now I can scratch my back; all my problems are solved!
Why does the Viking keep jumping out and hitting me with it??
Maybe I'll brush up on some string theory.
I think the librarian had a cat.
Good, I can hang my clothes up if I ever find a hook.
A log would probably be of more use.
The toad is losing interest.
The toad got away.
The wilderness and I came to a compromise.
It's very sharp.
It won't light trees on fire, but at least it's shiny.
Not great for fighting.
It won't make flaming pits, but at least it's shiny.
It's very pointy.
It won't light rocks on fire, but at least it's shiny.
Why did I build this?
I prefer sharp implements
Three times the pointiness.
So what does the feather do again?
It smells like burnt hair.
It's so uncomfortable.
I'm going to raze some villages!
Was it worth it? I think it was worth it.
I bet it stinks under the saddle.
It's a big block of slobbery salt.
Or I could just burn my way through.
I don't want to scuff it up.
Not as good as fire, but I guess it has its uses.
What's it even for?
Hey, now I can weigh my fish... not that I care.
I like fire.
I could watch it for hours.
BURN! BURN FASTER!
Burn!
This fire is small and boring.
Uh oh. It's almost gone!
Awww. It's all over.
I should make the fire come back.
Fire is so pretty.
It's not real fire, but it's still pretty fun.
Fire on the inside is amazing!
Fire is not meant to be contained like this!
I like fire of all kinds.
I could watch it for hours, even though it's cold.
BURN! BURN FASTER! AND BLUER!
BURN! BURN FASTER!
Burn!
This fire is small and boring.
This fire is small and boring. And blue.
Uh-oh. It's almost gone!
Awww. It's all over.
I should make the fire come back.
I'm not sure about this...
Do you like your house, fire? You're welcome.
The light is so cold and alien.
Not for torching boats.
Light without a flame, I don't like it one bit.
I could watch it for hours.
BURN! BURN FASTER!
I feel so pampered!
This fire is small and boring.
Uh oh. It's almost gone!
I should make the fire come back.
I knew that goopy stuff'd burn good!
Burn the sea!!
Yess!! Burn!!!
It's burning alright.
That's barely even a fire!
That doesn't even count as a fire!
Quick!! Relight it!
A little fire hat.
Ugh. I can still smell the jerkiness.
Make the fire come back!
This dumb mushroom's not lighting up.
Not as nice as a warm fire.
C'mon, you saw that coming.
I've got a few ideas on how to light it. Heh heh.
Pfft, well that was a bright idea.
Now what?
It's my lucky lighter!
I could fit like a million lighters in here.
I made a backpack out of butts!
I'll catch those creepy birds.
I can catch a bug!
Fishing for the answer with a hook, line and sinker.
Musty.
It's too frilly.
I got all the badges in Girl Scouts.
It's a bit passive aggressive, but it'll work.
Eww, do I have to?
It burns! But, where's the fire?
I love the color!
North!
South!
East!
West...
Northeast!
Southeast!
Northwest!
Southwest!
Can't get a reading.
We could hide some gross things, I guess.
I'm not just gonna wrap air!
Now I can burn a bunch of things in one go!
Fuzzy backpack!
I donno... it could put out some fires....
They taught us how to make these in Girl Scouts.
I couldn't get comfortable there.
It's not time for siestas, it's time for fighting!
I can't take a siesta while tummy is grumbling!
I'd really rather be inside.
Well, I've still got my badges.
I always set them on fire.
A fire would liven this thing up!
Frozen solid.
It's stone cold.
No flame, no real heat... what fun is that?
Look at how it glows!
Pretty as can be!
Thatch you very much.
Carrying this will build chest muscles.
I have to wear this soggy thing on my back?
I donno... it could put out some fires....
I bet monkeys would have a ball with this thing.
Pretty as can be!
This'll help if I'm ever poisoned.
Keeps the elements away, but it would burn so easy.
I guess if I can't burn those bugs...
Here birdie birdie...
You could fit like a million lighters in here.
It's a backpack made out of butts!
Gonna catch those creepy birds.
Doesn't fit over Webber’s big head.
Eww, no!
I expected it to be blacker.
Don't you dare stick that in me!
Boo! Hissss!
No fun, making me exercise to stay cool!
I can't WAIT to light it!
My childhood buddy - Bernie!
Help me, Bernie!
GET'EM, BERNIE!!
I need to fix Bernie up.
I'm sure Warly won't mind if I borrow this.
I could put food in it and fire underneath it.
The fire still has quite a bit of work to do.
The fire is doing its thing!
I'm glad I cooked with fire.
That can't go in there.
Come on fat bees, make me honey!
Nothing to see here.
Patience.
Yay! I can steal honey!
Sigh. It's a pile of dirt.
Hurry up, dirtpile. Feed me!
Oh boy. Vegetables.
Stupid thing needs poop.
That is the opposite of fire.
I want to hang some meat!
Come on meat, dry already!
It's ready!
At least it went out in a blaze of glory.
Smoked you out!
It was a nice finale.
Forget the rain! Dry!
Maybe the fire wasn't the best drying method...
A bucket full of nasty.
The mussels like this stick for some reason.
Guess I should chuck'em in the ocean.
I gotta put something in there to grow fish.
Still no fish yet.
Yesss! A fish!
Three fish are better than one.
I feel like there could be more, though.
I'm swimming in fish!
It better not put out any of my fires.
All food must be cleansed with fire.
Fire makes everything better. Mmm!
Come on fat bees, make honey!
Yay! Let's steal honey!
It's just a dumb log.
There's mushrooms growing in it now.
Gross, they're taking over!
Geez, who even needs that many mushrooms?
Nasty. Let's burn the rot out.
Mold problem's taken care of.
I'm sure fire would fix that.
Just a dumb pot.
Good. Let's eat!
Shakes things up a bit.
All that work better be worth it.
All that work for just a little bit of spice?
Even I don't know everything, yet.
It would be better if it measured fire.
Rain is the anti-fire. Boo!
All the lightning can come here!
Aww, all glow but no fire.
Oooooooooh! Shiny!
There's no learning from that now.
If you'd measured fire, maybe you woulda been prepared!
Take that, rain!
And stay off!
I wish you'd shut your lid and stop putting out fires.
Almost out.
Electrical doo-dah, doo-dah.
Can things burn at sea?
It turns fire into ice. Boo.
It's fully fueled!
It needs more fuel.
It's nearly out of fuel.
It's out of fuel.
I can use this drill at sea.
Oh yeah! Lots of fire!
Fan the flames.
I guess I could show everyone where I've been.
Yes!!
Scouts don't need maps anyway...
Hm... I could make things that DON'T burn?
Haha!
I'd like to see someone try to sculpt with that!
I'm gonna carve a stone butt.
Naw, can't make it fit.
I guess that's good, too.
Awww, we already know that one!
Watery nerd stuff.
Heh heh. Whoops.
I hate that arrow!
Feel my wrath!
Pleased to meat you!
It's not the most exciting weapon.
Stupid boomerang!
Good practice for blowing into a fire.
The tranquilizer will make it easier to light on fire.
This is my favorite thing in the whole wide world.
Sports are hard.
A waste of flammable materials.
Now I can take on the world!
If I have to fight I might as well be protected.
Bees inside. Should've put some fire in there for good measure.
It would be better with fire.
Yay! More FIRE!!!
It'd be way cooler if it was on fire...
Always whirling! Swirling towards destruction!
I hope I don't jab myself.
A sick kiss.
First it booms, then it burns.
Here we go...
Only thing better than a spear is the gun that shoots them.
This sword smells.
Ox-cellent!
Try me, baddies.
It's so... heavy.
This way I won't get burned by those cacti.
Weapons are only good if they're twice your size.
For bashing things.
This feels gross. I hope it works.
This is the nastiest thing I've ever made.
This is the worst.
This protects my brain.
I feel like a tin can.
Fire makes it go boom.
That looks good for jabbin'!
Tranquilized things are easier to light on fire.
That's my favorite thing in the whole wide world.
If you're gonna fight you might as well be protected.
It's got a name scratched on the inside... 'W', uh...
I prefer a flame, but to each her own.
Lightning is sort of like fire.
This means I'm the boss now.
Who's ready for a nap!
Matches my prickly personality.
Bird prison!
Ha! I have you now!
Stupid bird. Wake up!
These pigs have questionable taste in architecture.
He's doing pig things in there.
You jerk! Let me in!
Ugh. Stupid rabbits.
Hmmm. I wonder if these will burn.
That looks so flammable!
I hate hiding.
That could totally catch on fire.
These are surprisingly heavy.
Eh. I guess that's OK.
It's a trunk for my junk.
Less reading! More burning!
I'd rather burn them.
It's like a sign, but smaller.
Looks kinda bare.
But what should I even draw??
Haha oh man, who drew THAT?
No point just leaving it on the ground.
I'm not painting that.
I guess we could pen stuff in with it.
Nice redecorating job!
Ha! Good result.
It was flammable!
It did catch on fire!
The trunk burned nicely.
I'm not sure why you'd want something that DOESN'T burn...
Hahaha, yesss!
It's cute, I guess.
It's a castle made of sand. A sandcastle.
Add fire and you'd get BBQ!
What a monkey sty.
You don't look like you would easily burn.
It's all bumpy.
A bunch of hotheads live here.
So I put this on the ground?
Keeps the home fires burning.
Here goes!
Time to get outta here.
Buoy, I'm glad I have this.
I keep all my best stuff in there.
It's the castle of the bouncy things... A bouncy castle.
I could put it down, I guess.
I feel like this is not the most safe.
It doesn't burn but it does keep the pests out.

Don't Starve Together
BirdcageBirdcage (occupied)- 
Ha! Gotcha now!
What's all the fuss about?
He won't be quiet!
At least he's quiet now.
Maybe I should clean that up.
I should burn something into it.
It said 'Don't play with matches', but the 'Don't' is crossed out now.
I'm telling you, there's a monster hand under that thing!
Just a bunch of dumb flowers.
Not as good as a fire, but at least we won't be in the dark.
We're gonna be in the dark soon.
Those need replacing.
Alright, alright, so I was wrong about the hand!
Ha! He thinks he's people!
It's a burning man.
Just burnt straw.
I guess I could carry it.
Safe for now.
I think I'm in love.
I want to set it on fire.
Yes! Burn!
Aww, the fire burned out.
Nah, too much effort.
That's way better than some dumb dresses!
Stop hogging it, I wanna dress up too!
We're keeping it.
I shouldn't burn it... but I want to...
Did I do that? It's hard to keep track.
What's all this stuff for?
Hahaha-! Uh, I mean, oh no...
What can I tie up with this?
Boards. They'll burn, same as other wood.
Perfectly squared for maximum enjoyment.
I bet it'd burn!
Weird!
Eww, it's still warm!
That's none of my beeswax.
Heh, we rubbed a bunch of paper in beeswax.
Amazing the things you can do with bamboo.
Rock hard, er, stone.
It's a bottle.
Nice bald spot, rock.
It won't even set on fire.
What should we tie up??!
Great. A rock with a hole in it.
I guess we just... plant it? In the dirt?
That took way too much effort.
That's my insurance policy.
I can use the hat like a cauldron!
A dark and powerful energy radiates from it.
Music is boring.
It's like fire, but purple!
Like being wrapped in smoke.
It's like my dreams can hurt real things!
I can do the pyrotechnics too!
I can hit my enemies with it.
Oh, ick! Ick! Ick! Ick! Eeeeeewwwwww!
Boo to this.
Has science gone too far?
I'm invincible! Well, maybe not. But it feels good.
This is my absolute favorite toy.
Booooring.
It's quite a rush to use.
I can feel the magic!
It needs something more.
I wonder how they hover?
It's so empty!
My policy was canceled.
Double, double toil and... oh. It's burned.
Now it's dark and not very powerful.
Is it New Year's Eve? Are there FIREWORKS?!
This is just ridiculous.
Now it's more my style.
I hear a storm a-coming.
What's a pig going to teach me?
I'd prefer to burn my enemies but... meh.
That's where I came in.
I should leave.
Think of the things I can burn with it!
Now I don't have to lug everything around with me.
Reminds me of my lighter. It keeps away the darkness.
That's our insurance policy.
Our policy was canceled.
It's like dreams that can hurt real things!
That thing's great for batting at enemies.
I have no idea what it does, but it feels good to wear it!
That's my absolute favorite toy.
Pfft. It'll burn like the rest.
What the heck? I can still see the moon!
A new moon! Great, I hated the old one!
The moon is waxing, unlike me.
That's as full as it gets.
The moon's outta here!
Doesn't work down here.
Magic stuff.
Walking's for suckers.
He wouldn't mind if I use this for kindling, right?
Burn it. BURN. IT.
Yup, looks cursed alright.
But destruction is so much more fun!
Smells like rabbit butt.
A hat made of straw. To think, it could've been tinder.
I've taken his hair and put it on my own!
This will keep the pokeys off of me.
I am a phoenix!
It's not warm enough for my liking.
A top hat and a lighter, a perfect combination.
Not as nice as a flaming vest, but it'll do.
Now I'll be with my friend forever.
Not as warm as a good fire, but still pretty good!
Too passive!
A halo of flowers. Too bad it's not a burning halo of flowers.
I can walk more easily with this!
Cuddly hat.
Well, that's one use for this fruit.
It's a real damper on my mood.
This'll do the trick.
Anything to keep the water away.
Vests are so in.
I wonder if it'd burn as nicely as actual flowers do.
If I wear it, I don't have to look at it...
It's like swimming in fur.
I feel smarter, but also gross...
Water just runs right off it.
This coat makes me feel dangerous.
It squishes when I move...
Wind is the enemy of fire.
This might not be the safest thing to light fires in.
I like not smelling smelly smells.
Brisk movement snuffs fires...
Wearing this gives me a toothy grin.
If I bought this in a store I'd feel burned.
Cuts down on the coughing.
Meh. Not my style, but I'll wear it.
This looks good on me.
Beast hair to go over people hair!
A phoenix reborn!
Now my friend will never leave.
It's way easier to cover ground with this!
It's a real mood dampener.
That'll do the trick.
Keeps the rain out your eyes and in someone else's.
What a great look!
Not very stylish.
I don't like having my head messed with.
Yuck, it feels like snot.
Yuck, who'd want a face like that?
I don't think it would burn.
Will they fit in my pockets?
And they'll huff and they'll puff!
Looks normal to me.
It's warning me.
The fuel is coming to life!
It's almost humming.
I think it's turning off.
I guess it's nearly over.
I don't think it's working.
It picks up my burning materials for me!
It seems to absorb the darkness around it.
I feel my mind opening when I wear it.
It gives me a headache.
It's magical.
It won't start a fire but I guess it's still useful.
It's so useful!
It seems like there's something flowing through it.
Not sure I want to wear this.
This will keep the nasties at bay.
It's no good until I place it.
I wish it lit stuff on fire.
Will those fit in my pockets?
It picks up burning materials!
Human beings probably shouldn’t wear this.
It's no good until it's been placed.
Campfire wood has other uses!
It would be unwise to light this on fire while at sea.
Rowing? Really?
I can carry so many flammables on this.
I'd like to see something try to take a bite out of this boat.
Crumbly.
A fine ship.
This should patch up any little leaks.
It makes use of the wind.
Nice stitching.
What a morbid sail.
Gotta hand it to those dumdums... they make good sails!
Now we're gettin' somewhere.
Wonder if I can start fires with this?
Can't stop me now!
C'mon, swim inside! It's cozy in there!
Just a big hunka junk without fuel.
It's a fixin' machine.
Running low.
I guess I should turn it back on.
It's getting me fuel for burnin'! Heheheh.
That's gonna need more fuel.
I'll catch a bunch of wet stuff with this.
What's in the baaaag?
I believe that bag is sinking.
It's going to sink soon!
You can't hide from me now, islands!
I can see to the ends of the Earth.
I no longer have that sinking feeling.
I feel piratey and naughty.
I don't think it was made for me.
But will it keep my lighter dry?
It'd be better if I could light it on fire.
A fire machete is a girl's best friend!
Such an axe! Cuts AND burns?!
I poke. They burn!
Hit me and burn!
The Obsidian gives more boom for my buck.
Hope no fires get blown out.
I'm the queen of this boooooat!
I am a goddess of fiery destruction!
Those traps are goners now.
This only smashes little bits off things.
You mean I have to do work?
A poor substitute for my lighter.
They're kinda dull in the daytime.
Fire is so versatile.
Pig houses look pretty different here.

The Sterling Trough Deli- 
Food!
I wonder if they have matches.
For all my cuts and bruises.
I can't believe I ever took food stores for granted.
For growing stuff.
A lot of weird things to burn in there.
Are there books about magical fires in there?
Maybe they have a flaming axe in there.
Maybe I could use a new hat.
Museums usually have something on Great Fires.
A bunch of big shots in there.
Now I can build more things to burn.
That's where that bossy jerk works.
My own office to burn down.
Now I can hire a guard to help me burn stuff!
There's probably something wrong with it.
I wonder how long before it burns down.
What's there to guard from, exactly?
More rooms mean more room for fires.
Burn! Burn it all down!
Dang. Won't burn.
Boring floor.
That's not going to burn.
Dang. It won't burn.
It's not even done!
Dang. It won't even burn!
Boring pig floor.
Might be flammable.
Blah.
Can't even set this on fire.
Marble isn't flammable.
Can't even set this on fire.
Ugly.
I deserve better.
Is this a fridge, or...
Everything's slanted!
What even is this?
Yawn.
Snore.
Boring.
Ugh. So boring.
A dish of boring.
Pretty. Pretty boring.
A hanging bunch of boring.
A soggy sack of boring.
So boring.
Zzzzz...
A lot of boring.
A container for boring.
Awww...Still boring.
Gross... and boring.
It'd be better if I burnt it.
Nice, but I still want to burn it down.
So what?
Oohh... fancy.
Dang. Won't burn.
It's a boring wall.
Where'd the eyes go?
It's nice, but will it burn?
This definitely won't burn.
Could be better.
Psht. I'm not impressed.
Sheesh. Someone doesn't care.
This needs fire.
Ugly.
Someone just dressed up boring.
Dressed up boring.
Ugly.
Boring.
Bunch of mushy nonsense.
A bunch of rocks.
Ugh.
It's no lighter.
Stabby things.
I don't get it.
Can't even set it on fire.
Well that's dramatic.
Not even fires?
Ugh. It still smells.
I never liked them when they were alive.
It'd be better if I could burn it.
I like this.
Stuff to build a small house.
A bunch of things to build a fancy house.
There's a lot of non-flammable wrought iron in this.
Brick isn't known for being flammable
Ugh. Stone is so heavy. And fire-proof.
I can build this house and then burn it down.
I'll build my own fireplace to set fires in.
It's wood. I could burn it.
Not even burnable.
It's curtains for that door.
What's it smiling about?
Ha ha! That bat's dead.
Outside is boring.
I need a better decorator.
Pretty and boring.
A big window looking out into nothing.
What are you looking at?
Soft and ugly.
Haha. That's what you get.
Ugly. And boring.
Take that, abomination.
Ugh. So ugly.
Ha! That's what you get.
This isn't flammable.
Ew.
Can't even set this on fire.
I'm not stepping on that.
Interesting...
A fire hazard. I like it.
A boring old lamp.
Needs fire.
A boring old lightbulb.
Circular boring.
Rectangular boring.
Ugly.
Ugh. What even is that?
Chess is boring.
Nothing's on it? I can burn it then, right?
You're the perfect lapwarmer.
Hah, you don't even know you're smelly.
Look at those creepy little eyes. Aww.
We were made for each other.
Aww, I could just squish your gross lil face!
I could just eat you up.
She loves flames!
Ouchhh! I think I chipped a tooth.
I prefer smoky fires.
What sort of peasant doesn't have a torch?!
That one looks like it could do some damage.
A horse with no butt.
Just some dumb bishop piece.
I don't wanna see what comes outta that!
Ewww, she doesn't have a head!
I'm not afraid of that guy. He doesn't even have arms!
We kicked its butt.
Those are some pointy teeth.
Looks as dumb as the real thing.
I think... I think I understand art.
Meh. I can't even burn it.
It's hard to burn stuff at sea.
I guess it's nice.
Looks like a jerk.
I'd rather burn things down than build them up.
The moon HATES trees.
Haha, this thing could take an arm off!
I still don't want to take a bath.
That's the boat part of the boat.
Rowing's dumb. Why don't we just use a sail?
Ugh. Can it be someone else's turn to row?
Fixing stuff is boring, but necessary.
Ooo, let's build an anchor.
You can't call it 
Just think how much cooler it'd look if I set it on fire.
Can't sail without that.
I'll burn through this book!
Less reading, more burning!
Ughh, who cares?
Bo-oring!
That's my favorite book!
Looks like kindling to me!
At least something around here can hold it together.
It flings big stinkin' rocks.
Is this thing on?
Hehehe!
Well, that was mildly entertaining.
So no more night fires then?
Iunno, it's Winona's junk.
It's on its last legs.
Oops. It broke.
More of Winona's weird junk.
I think Wormwood made it.
It's got really sharp thorns.
That's disgusting!
Powdered stink.
It's like drinking candy.
I like the way it sets my mouth on fire.
People say I'M salty.
I'm gonna stuff so much candy in there!
That's wayyyy better than a regular apple!
Do people actually eat these or are they just a bad joke?
These are a meow-uthful.
I'm gonna need about a dozen of these.
Yesssss! Lollipops!
Eww! I hate black licorice!
Why does something so yummy have to look so gross!
Ewwww it's corn flavored!
Burn them!!!
Hey Wolfgang, eat one and tell us what it is!
Yuck! That's disgusting!
It's sorta tangy.
Mmm! It burns my mouth so good!
Looks like firewood to me.
Just a big dumb ball.
Hey Wes! Dare you to drink the last bit!
Pfft, they're not even sharp.
Ughhh! That's so nasty!
Ewww! Who would ever wear that!
It makes stuff look small no matter which way I turn it.
Who needs just one glove?
Snails are gross!
Ooo, it's warm.
I don't like snakes.
Yeesh. I can feel the nostalgia dripping off it.
It's just junk.
It's got kind of a dumb face, huh?
I never take my pigtails out anyway.
I like the fire!
It's like there's a fire in my belly.
Ah. The strong stuff.
I wish it was a little stronger.
I didn't think it was possible to make fire better.
Piping hot mutation juice!
It's a stick. But I can't even set it on fire.
Should I wait until it gets bigger to set it on fire?
I should decorate for Halloween.
I'm gonna stick you in a tree.
I should hang it somewhere and scare people.
Can I set it on fire?
Ugh. I hate those jerks.
Wish it was flammable.
Were those bats, or am I just seeing things.
Haha! Those bats don't scare me anymore!
Ribbons burn real good!
It's for me right?!
Are we gonna grow a tree?
Happy Winter's Feast, everybody.
It's a bit shrimpy.
Looks great!
Now we're celebrating!
Honestly, who DOESN'T eat the head first?
Anyone else sense the overpowering stench of evil?
Doesn't look too bad, considering!
Gimme two of 'em and I can do a MacTusk impression.
A log for eating, not for burning.
I'm gonna totally stuff my face!!
Sure beats rainwater!
I only like it when it's SCALDING.
Who knew stuff from a bird's butt could be so tasty?
Bibble-ty bauble-ty boo!
It's like a fire, but without the burning!
Woah, shiny! Nice!
I should toast this over an open fire.
So cute I don't even wanna burn it.
I don't even like gobblers!
What do we have to do now?
Well, that's burned now.
What a great color!
I don't think I'm supposed to spend this.
Light'em up!
Anything with a fire in it is okay by me.
It's a big ol' fan.
Sooo ferocious!
Aww, I always get caught in the middle!
I wanna be the caboose!
That looks WAY better!
It's missing something. Like fire.
That's what we were supposed to do, right?
I may've misunderstood.
Heh heh. STAY.
This dog is stone cold!
Welp, that's a weird shape for a rock.
How'd you get your eyes to do that?!
Did someone carve this thing?
Trading diagrams is for dorks.
It almost looks friendly.
It doesn’t look so tough now.
Where's the shrine to me?
Needs meat.
Burnt. I like it.
I'm gonna eat it all!
Nah. I'll feed it to something.
A little snack to fill my belly.
I'd burn it, but it might be worth something.
Eat dirt!
You, I like.
Sure does like using those signs.
All washed up.
Naw. It's too late.
Aww... You mean I gotta clean up first?
Not now! There's big jerks around.
Pfft, I bet he can't even fight.
Keep that snout to yourself!
Jeez, what's his crocodeal?
Hey! How am I s'pose to hit you with all that armor?
It's got a weaponized butt!
You can't push me around.
He looks pretty haggard.
Pfft. Whatever Rhinocebros.
Bet you think you're safe in all that armor.
This is WAY better than our gate back home!
Time to go.
There's no key in it.
Looks good.
Jerks come out of it.
Kill that flag!
That spider's so tiny!
Woah! I love it!
I could take a crack at it.
So I just wave it and FIRE APPEARS?
Looks like kindling to me.
Looks interesting, for a book.
That weapon looks boring.
I don't want to use that.
Looks cumbersome.
That's Woodie's axe.
No way I can use that!
Ptoo! Now you're dead!
Ooh, the firepower!
FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!
This armor isn't very good.
It barely does anything.
This armor will stop a blow or two.
Good for smackin' stuff.
I could do neat stuff more often with that.
That armor looks pretty safe.
Nothing's gonna get through that!
Woohoo! I should put that on.
So pointy!
I'd wear it if I felt like hitting stuff.
Dibs!
It's a feather crown!
Ohh, I want it!
Ooo, gimme!
Comes with a matching staff!
That's a great wreath!
I don't even wanna burn it!
Hey! Get back up!
You got this!
Thanks for the hand!
I'm not using that!
Her eyes creep me out.
He'll eat just about anything.
Hey, what'dya got for me?
Nice hat. Are you selling that, too?
They're not so different from the pigs back at our place.
It's taking a nap.
Not the prettiest face.
Haha. You're old.
I haven't got any crumbs for you.
It's dead.
Don't worry, I won't kick you.
But I want more berries!
I can take my pick of them.
They're so hideous they're almost cute.
Hey! Give me more mushrooms!
That one stayed in the ground too long.
Well. Might as well burn it now.
It smells kind of pepper-y.
That's not growing back.
Aw! It's impervious to fire.
It's kinda useless now.
It's taking forever!
Sap's ready!
Stupid bugs.
You don't look so hot, tree.
Yawn.
Don't. Look. Up.
I wonder where all the food goes. Probably somewhere gross.
I'm just gonna keep jumping through portals til I figure out a way home.
Haha! Look at this dumb goat statue.
Ew. It's ugly.
It's so busted, I don't even wanna light it on fire.
What a waste. It could've burned down.
What's a chimney without a fireplace?
Ugh! It won’t even burn.
That would look better on fire.
It'd be better if it was burnt.
The roof isn't on fire.
Gross.
Ugly.
It's just asking to be burned down.
Hey pigs! Your house blew down!
That looks sharp.
I can't even burn it open!
Didn't even have to melt the locks.
I can smash stuff down with it.
A fountain with no water. Maybe that's a metaphor?
Boring.
What's so great about her?
That's what passes for a village around here, I guess.
Ha! Cracked it.
I can't get it to open.
There's a lot of stuff to burn in there.
I'd burn it, but I need the things in there.
Blech! Tastes like ocean.
It's stone. I can't burn it.
Just an old lamp post.
Whatever. It's a lamp.
I'd love to burn that to ashes.
Cremation is the only way to do it.
Metal doesn't burn well.
We're gonna cook that up real nice.
It needs to be set up in a firepit.
I set it up. Now what?
I can't wait to use it!
Now we're cooking!
Now we're cooking.
I should set it up over the firepit.
If it was bigger I could use more fire.
Ugh, I guess I should set it up.
Fire it up!
It goes on the fire.
It goes with the fire.
I should light a fire under its butt.
It's kinda small.
Fancy.
Sweet stuff goes in there.
We can use it to get some cooking salt.
Grow faster, salt crystals!
Gotta dredge the salt up.
That'll show those crabs.
You mean I gotta do work?
I'd rather burn things.
Now we can get sap out of the trees.
I'll use this if I can't burn it open.
There's more stuff to burn in the park.
Fancy key.
Aw... I won't know what these are until I plant them.
It's just a bunch of seeds.
Look at it, flopping around like that.
All it needed was some fire.
Needs more fire.
I bet it's tasty.
Leaf this to a professional.
It's totally raw. Fire could fix that!

GarlicGarlic- 
It's just a couple cloves of garlic.
Fire made it better.
It's so bulbous.
Roasting. My favorite cooking method.
We grew it in that gross muck.
Cooking just means sticking stuff in fire.
Cutting these is a pain.
It just needed a couple minutes on the fire.
Haha gross, I hate turnips.
Take that, turnip.
How on earth do you eat this?
Can you just eat flour?
What? We needed milk.
I licked one. Had to.
I need a pinch or two on all my food.
Mmm! Pure sugar!
Well that's dumb.
Mmmm...
It's a piece of that pepper-y bush.
Spices... the true spice of life.
Wow. A coin. Pfft.
I can probably buy something good with this.
I'm rich!
Guess that thing liked what we gave it.
Maybe that thing up there'll eat it.
It doesn't want that. Might as well burn it.
This should shut that thing up for a while.
This won't shut it up for long.
Looks good to me.
Ohh. Look who's fancy now!
Now I don't have to use my hands.
I can't even burn it!
It's already on a dish!
Ugh! I can't use that dish for that food!
I have to wait for it to eat this one first.
I wouldn't serve that to a dog!
You mean there's another key?!
But I want to use it!
Okay, so that didn't work.
Whoops, burnt it. Heh heh.
I think it's angry!!
Let's get out of here!
It looks like it would burn well.
Die in a fire!
It looks dangerous!
One less tree in the world.
Not so spiky now, are you?
YES! BURN!
I wish it was still burning.
You'll be a real tree soon.
Wood! So flammable! Hooray!
Burn, log, buuuurn!
Mmmm. Smells like fire.
Hey there, tree seed.
The worst kind of tree. The non-flammable kind.
It might be alive, but it'll still burn.
It looks upset.
I should pick it.
Poor little limp tree.
Burn! Yeah!
What's the matter, got no dirt?
A bunch of small twigs. Good for fires, among other things.
What a sorry looking piece of... grass?
Grass stubble is kind of useless.
It needs poop.
Fire! Wooo!
Cut grass, ready for burning. Or maybe crafting.
Mmmmm. Berries.
I want more berries!
Eat poop, stupid plant!
It's a burnable clump of reeds.
I can't do anything with reed stubble.
Cut reeds, ready for burning. Or maybe crafting.
I'll eat it if I have to.
Hurry up, you stupid plant!
Oh boy. Vegetables.
It's all planty.
It looks sharp.
Those thorns hurt!
Burn, thorns!
I don't have time to waste on flowers.
Stupid flowers. They're almost useless.
Ugh, that smells terrible.
Ew, they're sticky.
Maybe its special carrot friend is in the ground.
Pretty!
Stupid mushroom.
Dumb mushroom.
Hey! You! Get up here!
Maybe it will return some day.
It looks like it would burn well.
One less tree in the world.
YES! BURN!
I wish it was still burning.
You'll be a real tree soon.
It's so dry, it's like it wants to be on fire.
Nice and dry, ready to burn!
All dried out. Primed for fire!
It's crackly and dry. Good kindling!
Hey there, tree seed.
Spines! My weakness! How did you know?
We'll call it a tie.
It looks highly flammable.
Kindling!
That's a whole lot of tree to burn!
I bet these crackle and pop when they burn.
It'll come back.
That took a few swings.
That's how you untangle them.
Wooow! So much fire!
Those were fun to burn!
Leftovers from a fire. I wish it was still here.
A major improvement.
You need ground, fast.
Would you like to go back into the ground?
A future forest fire.
Looks flammable.
I could use this in something. Or just burn it.
This doesn't need to be watered.
Genius idea, hiding out with these dumb regular corals.
Soggy sea grass.
No need to water this guy.
Burned right down to the, uh, water.
You have a curious lack of branches.
An edible tree thing.
You're green, but you'd burn.
There's something odd about this tree...
Plant-y.
I bet that will burn.

Claw Palm Tree BurntClaw Palm Tree (burnt)- 

Claw Palm Tree StumpClaw Palm Tree (stump)- 

CorkCork- 
Still sets on fire.
It won't even set on fire.
It's a tree.
Yes! Fire! Fire!
Much better.
No one can save you now, rainforest.
I can burn it down and it won't be so sick.
Looks burnable.
Looks like kindling to me.
Baby firewood.
It'll burn. That's all I care about.

Tea Tree BurntTea Tree (burnt)- 

Tea Tree StumpTea Tree (stump)- 

Seed PodSeed Pod- 
If I plant it, it will grow more things to burn.
It's not even worth burning.
An axe won't destroy this but fire will.

Tall GrassTall Grass- 
This grass is tough!
It's kinda ugly. But it'll burn.
I could eat that.
Haha! Found you!
What are they hiding from?
This smells so strong it clears my nose.
Nothing here yet.
It really doesn't like this dirt.
Why you so happy being wet?
I bet this would like to be in the ground.
Let's see if it's flammable.
Pretty. But will it burn?
Ugh, vines!
That's a big ol' tree.
Can I eat it? Or burn it?

Lily PadLily Pad- 
I can't burn stuff out on the water.
A fancy bush or something.
It's just a big shrub.
I might be able to shave that.

Hedge (burnt)- 

Intricate Topiary- 
Someone spent a lot of time pruning this kindling.
I guess it's okay.
Wish I could burn it.
Wish I could burn it!
What's that doing there?
I can't even burn it.
Broken, but not burnt.
It'd be worth it to pick that.
Yes!! Burn!!
But I want more berries!
It's just reed stubble.
It's so dry, it's like it WANTS to be on fire.
I should burn that thing before it reaches full ugliness.
It looks sharp.
How are you supposed to get the sticks from up there??
One less tree in the world.
YES! BURN!
I wish it was still burning.
Fire would release it from its torment.
It'll grow... unless something fiery happens to it.
Looks like campfire fuel to me!
Blech. You smell.
Burn the sick!
Ready for picking!
Make mooooore!
Yes!! Burn!!
Did I say you could stop growing?!
What's the matter, got no dirt?
It's burning up.
That makes no sense!
What sort of bush doesn't burn?!
I'd like to burn this flower in particular.
It's a small, unburned plant.
It's been picked.
I bet we could eat that.
Nothing left to take.
Haha! This thing's great.
This tree looks super weird.
I could still burn the stump.
YES!
Well, that was fun.
Perfect for burning.
It's so pretty, I might actually feel bad burning it!
It's not gonna grow back.
HAHA, YES!
I don't feel as bad as I thought I would.
This would look even prettier if it was on fire.
Just an un-burned baby tree.
It's a fruit bush of some sort.
Someone took the fruit already.
It's not going to grow fruit anymore.
Pfft, it's barely even hot out.
I think it's getting sick.
EW, it smells!!
Yesss!
Ewww it's got a little arm.
It's full of bees!
I had better keep my distance.
It's waxy.
Uh oh, I don't like the look of that.
Gross.
I guess I should touch it?
I wonder what these markings mean.
Where'd it go?
Am I seeing things?
Doesn't look flammable. How boring.
What a nice statue. Shame if something were to happen to it.
I wonder if the rest burnt down.
It's heavy!
No-one would care if this burned down.
That's what you get for being so stinky!
I guess I have it alright.
These pigs sure know how to have a good time.
It's too hard to break!
Just another rock to me.
Can I make inukshuks with these?
The poor man's fire-starter.
There are tiny explosions trapped inside.
Where am I going to spend this.
It's full of dead stuff, I bet.
Better it than me.
Who just leaves dirt lying around in the forest?
It leads to my new friend.
Ohh... he got away.
I'll find you!
I like the way the symbols glow.
I'm making a monstrosity!
Needs to be unlocked somehow.
I just want to see this world burn.
This is too precious to burn!.
What's this part good for?
It feels warm.
Perhaps I could melt it into a more pleasing shape.
Poke it with a stick!
I wonder if he likes spicy food?
I'll have to burn these clothes!
This pond will definitely not ignite. How dull.
I hope you at least went out in a blaze of glory.
That's just nasty.
Tons of tiny disgusting spiders.
Stupid rabbits. Come out so I can eat you.
Why does everyone have a nicer house than me?
I'm not going in there. Yuck!
Someone out there is all wet.
Where'd they go?
It's out there, but I'm over here...
Chilly.
I don't think there's any way it'd burn.
As useless as water ever was.
Boo! I lost track of him in this mud.
Down away from the sun. It's unnatural.
Stupid rabbits must be stuck down there.
Double whammy!
It can always get worse, I guess.
I wouldn't burn it while someone lives here.
It's all dried up and ready for burning.
Is that supposed to be something?
Looks about the same.
That gives me the willies.
Double whammy.
Come out and play with me!
Fish mongers.
No one would care if this burned down.
It's true, no one cares.
Why here, fishies?
The happy lobster home.
I wish I had a snorkel.
Pretty colors.
Haha, gross.
This gross food is trying to eat that rock.
The rock won't be bothered by those suckers for a bit.
Magma-nificent!
Glorious...
Ooo! I hope there are useful items inside.
Oh, look! It's some sand.
Big deal, it's sand.
My shark radar is burning.
Why is this sand dune here?
The biggest, fieriest fire in all the lands!
I think this hot rock is actually a hot egg.
What's making those bubbles?
Grr, I lost it!
The water's too rough to see!
Ooo, there's a big fishy nearby.
There's something flammable down there.
I bet that burns real good!
Would be better as a fire trap.
I wonder which way it would swirl if you flushed it?
What marvelous heat and fury!
Just out of reach.
You will be mine soon.
This seems like a waste of time...
I feel kinda dizzy looking at it.
It's filled with sea treats!
Did I do that?
If I burn it, whatever is inside burns too...
Blech!
Stupid seashell.
Nature is so gross.
My favorite type of barrel!
If I don't like the treasure I'll set the chest on fire.
He keeps me company.
Something's fishy here.
Someone has regrets.
Seems like it's missing a thing or two.
Wonder what this is used for.
A part for something.
Wonder what it does?
This goes with something else, I think.
Might as well see what's underneath.
Haha, that pile's huge!
Can't even set it on fire.
I could set that on fire.
Ugly.
Dang! Can't burn it!
Aww... It won't burn.
I should kick it.
I can't burn it with just my lighter.
Yeesh, there's a lot of sparkles in there.
It's probably not worth much.
I can't even burn it down.
I think it's a farmhouse.

Farm HouseQuarry Lodgings- 
Is that a mine?

Secret Bandit CampSecret Bandit Camp- 
Now I can steal his stuff.
Creepy things live there.
It must lead somewhere.
Ughh. I do not want to go in there.
Gross.
I should light it!
I have some burning questions.
Some old wall.
I'll take some of that.
I don't trust it.
I can't set it on fire.
Useless. Can't even burn it.
Psht. That didn't last long.
Well it has a 'W' on it so it must be mine.
I'm not lugging that around.
Useless. Can't even burn it.
Meh. I don't need it.
Do egg shells burn?
Needs some fire.
Where's the bird?
It looks old.
Aww... can't even light a fire in there.
Anyone there?
A cone full of jerks.
I'll touch it when I'm good and ready.
It's, like, a rock.
What's the point of collecting these again?
What should we spend it on??
It burrows away from the sun's skyfire. Unnatural.
The vines coil away from my lighter... weird!
Dare you guys to smack it with a hammer.
It all came from a bee's butt.
Ew, burn it before it gets any bigger!
Looks like a bunch of rubble to me.
Not burnable. Not interested.
It's a marble statue, I guess.
What a creepy load of junk!
The crank doesn't even turn!
That thing looks terrible.
I'm more used to destroying things than fixing them.
Humpty Dumpty's back together again.
He didn't even say 'thank you'.
Ew! It's wriggling!
Yes! Yessss!
Oh great, another stinkin' rock!
Ewwwwwwwwwww!
She hasn't put her face on for the day yet.
Yikes. I'd cover that up too if I were her.
It's an okay statue, I guess.
A brazier would be nicer.
Just another rock to me.
Well I can't burn it.
It's made of some kind of jerk rock I can't burn.
Oh look, a bunch of smashed up rocks!
It's expecting something from me.
Hurry up already, stupid rock!
Ughh! It's doing the exact opposite of burning!
That's obviously completely wrong.
Oh look! ROCKS! Ughhhhh!
How am I supposed to burn it now?
Is there anything cute in there??
The fire of %s's life was extinguished by %s.
What's a weird table doing out here? Let's burn it!
Gross! I told you we shoulda burnt it!
Ha, falling to pieces. Rookie mistake.
Great, now we've irritated some marble crime boss!
Gross. I don't think that was supposed to come off.
At least it doesn't smell anymore.
Lookit this big dumb lawn ornament!
Nothing says 'Open Me' quite like a lock!!
It's a bunch of water.
It's a bunch of dirt.
Let's just smash it up.
I can't get up there!
Do starfish usually have so many teeth?
Jeez, that was rude!
I knew I didn't like you.
Doesn't it feel nice to be back in one piece?
Almost done, I swear.
Yeah, of course I'll lug you over there.
Okay, let me take you home.
Where do you want to go?
Ew, I think it's whispering to me.
Iunno, maybe we can jam stuff in it.
So toasty and warm!
The bombs are fun to throw in.
Should we smash it up?
What's better than a hotspring? A fire pit!
Something inside is calling for me.
That's a big chunk of glass!
What do we need glass for anyway?
GROSS! What if I'd stepped on it by accident?
It's just a big boring sea rock.
I hope it burns.
Huh. That's... weird.
Okay, hear me out... what if I tried burning it.
Someone got all the salt already.
I wonder if it's flammable.
Be the phoenix.
Who plugged that hole?
I don't want to go in that gross hole!
I hope there's lava down there somewhere.
It's cooler down here, anyway.
It's too dark and stuffy down here.
Gross. It smells like leprechaun butt.
Gross. It's all mushroomy.
Gross. This tree is sick all over.
It's burning inside.
Bright!
Rocks are boring.
More boring rocks.
It's full of spiders.
I should burn them out.
What a wonderfully flammable home.
Looks flammable.
Fuel for the fire.
Looks burnable!
That's all I wanted!
Ugh! What a smell!
That looks pretty sturdy.
It's called a 'lightbulb' but it's kinda heavy.
There's too many people down there.
There's too many people up there.
What would happen if I dropped a match in there?
It's spreading junk everywhere.
Ew, I don't want to get too close.
Ack! It stinks!
That one got what it deserves.
It's like floating fire!
It has no idea where it's going.
It's like colorful sparks!
It feels flammable.
Looks like good kindling.
Light without fire. Unnatural.
It's just nasty old bits of bones!
Needs more gross old bits.
That looks absolutely ridiculous.
Looks passable.
Nah. Skeleton's not right.
It's not working.
Who plugged that hole?

AncientAncient FaceAncient Statue- 
Drat, won't burn.
The dead can't get through here.
Oooo! An afterlife intercom.
It must need a lot of water.
Dead windup horsey
Dead windup priest
Dead windup castle
Old furniture.
Bits and pieces, pieces and bits.
This Thulecite crumbled to pieces.
A crusty plant.
Kind of tacky.
I want big horns like that!
Light without fire is unnatural.
A very very old chest.
I think it's judging me.
Rude.
That did it!
Why would anyone want to live down here?
Something weird's going on.
It lit up!
Is it gonna explode?!
I'll come back another time.
It's in some other language.
Ew, creepy.
It's somehow even creepier when it's on.
It's got a picture of some gross looking people.
Can't tell what that was a picture of.
I think someone spilled ink on this picture.
Oh, gross! The people're losing their skin in this one!
It's just a picture of a city.
Eerily lifelike.
Fire items can be forged here!
Hot java from hot lava!
Aw, but I want another cup...
It needs ash and love. Mostly just ash.
I know just what to do with you.
Yowch!
Don't rub up against me!
And stay down!
I don't have to water you, right?
I could jabber on about this all day.
This rock makes me so excited I want to explode!
A fire rock!
It drops burned things!
You come pre-burnt!
A burning puddle of hork...
I guess he was bad to the bone.

Volcano AltarVolcano Altar of Snackrifice- 
An altar to the sate the fire gods!
Why would I wanna appease the volcano? Then it wouldn't shoot fire!
I hate to leave this place...
Wish I could burn it.
Rude.
Missed me.
Haha. Can't get me anymore.
I should take that off and sell it to a pig.
If that goes the whole thing will fall down.
I wish I could burn these.
I could put fire in there!
I wish... to see the world burn.
There's something different about this well.
Looks ominous. I like it.
Gross!
I won't burn it, but only because it makes me honey.
Sweet, sweet fire.
A baby jerk.
There's stuff in there I can steal.
Pompous.
How am I supposed to unlock that?
Dropping it is a lot more fun than pulling it back up.
Welp, there goes that.
I only know how to solve fire-based problems.
Are we allowed to climb it?
So, who're we gonna make walk it?
Check out how fast I can spin it!!
The ground is boring.
The ground is boring.
Gross...
The ground is boring.
Serene.
Explosive!
Squelchy.
Ashy.
Hot footin'.
The ground is boring.
The road is boring.
Does it burn?
My lighter doesn't work on it.
The ground is boring.
It's a pony!
It's a bishop!
It's a castle!
It looks pretty worn down.
Ahhh!
It has a nasty smile.
I'm not afraid of you!
OUCH! You jerk!
What a jerk!
I actually kind of like this one.
Gross! Cold!
It's sharp. I like it!
He's nasty. I should kill him.
Maybe I could kill it... with FIRE.
I could take him.
Maybe I should just leave that one alone.
Ha! I showed you!
He had it coming.
Eeeeew it's slimy and stinky!
Mmmmmm. Smooth.
Stay back, you big jerk!
I've got a new bag!
Eww, it's all swampy.
He's too damp to burn.
They're cute when they're sleeping.
I showed him!
Not at all cuddly.
It's pointy and slimy.
Ewwwww.
It's quivering.
I hear little digging sounds.
What a smell! Light a match next time!
Awwww, they want hugs!
I like his attitude!
Bring it on, piggie!
I can't kill what's already dead.
Stop following me!
He looks tasty.
Nom nom nom.
I kind of like the look of it.
So annoying!
Keep that mouth away from me!
Blood must bubble in currents muggy and thick.
Get away, you bloodsucking jerks!
What a frustrating jerk!
Get over here!
Cute little guy!
I bet a quick fire would take care of this.
It's mine now.
They spread like fire.
Do they have little fires in their bellies?
Doesn't look much different dead.
They come from above.
It's so furry!
Light without fire. Unnatural.
Does dirt normally move around?
I don't like your face!
Make a spark, it'll still burn.
You're a big mean jerk!
A fire would set him straight.
Aaah! Set it on fire!
You don't look that tough.
Back off!
I'm watching you!
Check out your boat, mate.
Flup off!
This blows.
What 'arrrr' you?
Shoo! Away!
Something disgusting dropped this.
Jerks that slither.
Those are some pointy fangs.
Leathery.
Maybe I could kill it... with FIRE.
Maybe I should just leave that one alone.
He had it coming.
Jerks that swim.
Now I've seen everything.
Ugh, fire would get rid of that smell.
I see fire in its eyes!
Victory doesn't smell very good...
If only I could figure out how to train one.
Go away! I didn't like you when you were alive!

Gnat SwarmGnat Swarm- 
Agh! They're too small to burn!
Yeesh. What are you so angry about?
He's after my money!
Sneaky!
Good. Now I can steal his stuff.
Doesn't look too dangerous to me.
Looks slimy.
Ugh, gross!
Wanna see what my lighter does?
You look like you'd burn well.
Ugh, what are you?!
It doesn't look so tough now.
One dead monkey.
Oh, you're creepy.
It must be tired from being such a jerk.
Creepy and dead.
Weird. Is it from a pig bat?
Jerks that can swim.
Stand still so I can burn you.
Ew.
I actually kind of like that one.
Ha! Showed you!
The holidays came early this year!
Showed him!
He's not the boss of me!
You can't kill what's already dead.
Gross! It's so meaty!
Marginally better smelling than most animals here.
Puffy flying jerk!
Why can't we be friends?
So... now what do we do with it?
The best way to solve any problem.
BURN ITTTT!
YUCK! What is that?!
Ewww I can see it breathing.
Good riddance.
BURN IT.
I don't wanna wake it.
Ew, it's dead.
I DEFINITELY have to burn that thing.
Now's the perfect time to burn it.
We should burn it. Just to be sure.
What a disgusting, hairy beast!
Er, are you following me?
They look even dumber when they're sleeping.
Ha! He's all naked now!
It's lost the fire from its heart.
You need to burn some calories.
Let's go!
I can see fire in its eyes.
Ha! I stole his hair!
I can hear those hairy beasts inside.
Even the babies are ugly.
WAKE UP!
It's fat, but that stinger looks dangerous.
I like the cut of that bee's jib.
Pocket full of bees!
Buzz!
It's pokey!
Ugh. They're fragrant.
Ick. It's following me.
I wonder how they taste.
Ha ha. A pig's butt.
Ugh. They look so stupid.
I won that argument.
We will be great friends!
He sure looks warm...
Run away tiny dancers.
We don't have much in common.
I want to blow it up!
Kaboom!
I love this stuff!
Heh. It broke.
It fits my head.
Less defense! More offense!
Joke's on you! I can burn this poo.
Your neck is gross.
Here, kitty!
I've kept stranger things than this.
Bouncy goat.
You're crazy!
I can hear the lightning if I hold it to my ear.
They make fish that big?
It's starting to spoil...
You don't look particularly flammable.
It's, like... a fin, I guess?
I'll call you 'Jerald'.
It's shriveling up.
You look pretty sturdy.
I could use an ox-tra one of these.
Hey lil' buddy, do you like to play with fire too?
Not wild about being close to this guy.
Great. It's a big one. Just what I need.
Sure you have impressive horns but can you light fires.
Yeesh. It's pretty big.
You're gross.
Still gross.
Gross and dead.
You're weird.
I could probably use this for something.
Hey! A doggy!
The guards don't look so tough.
Ha! Its owner is probably naked somewhere. Or dead.
The rabbits lost that argument.
It's perfectly head-shaped.
I've kept stranger things than that.
I heard lightning when I held it to my ear.
They're pretty cute.
Mmm... Roast dragonfruit.
Good night, little guy.
Flutter away, butterfly!
I want to squish it.
I think it's waiting for me to die.
Not so smart now, are you?
A redbird. The color of fire, but not a phoenix.
It's cozy in my pocket.
It looks cold out here. I bet it wants a fire.
It's so fluffy.
Crow feather. It probably smells terrible on fire.
Redbird feather. It probably smells terrible on fire.
Snowbird feather. It probably smells terrible on fire.
Evil bird! Get away from my yummy berries!
It's rude to stare.
At least it's not looking at me anymore.
I bet that eye thing was quite a sight wreathed in fire!
He's so fuzzy!
He looks tasty.
I have him where I want him!
I wish they didn't run away!
They're like little fires in my pocket!
That's not a normal plant.
Now that's just creepy!
Why did this plant have a face?
The fire didn't get rid of its face. Gives me the willies.
Argh, my little head!
It's fuzzy! And slimy...
Why does everything have to be a flower?!
I wonder if it burns...
I wish I saw the way that weird flower burned.
They're so small!
It's goopy and weird.
Hiding from the light, huh?
Coming up for a peek!
Out of the ground, into the fire.
It's a cold light. Not like a flame at all...
Stop running away!
I'm pretty sure a crabbit is hiding there.
Doesn't seem very smart.
Hey cutie, where's your mom?
This looks meaningful.
Leftovers from a fire. I wish it was still here.
Friend or foe?
Hey fancyfish, get over here!
Haha, it's squishy.
What a fiery color of red you are.
You're a skreechy scallywag.
Does it fear fire? It should.
'Squawk' yourself.
I like your nose.
It's got its butt in my water.
There is no spark behind its eyes.
A dummy is born every second.
This would burn.
Dumb egg.
The planet just got a little dumber.
Cooking this dumb egg was smart of me.
You poor little dummy.

Teen DoydoyTeen Doydoy (held)- 

WobsterWobster- 
Come here, you!
Ugh, bet you never get that fish smell out.
Huh. Doesn't even manage money.
He's napping.

Pig BeauticianBeautician- 
What a piece of work!
She's sleeping.

Pig CollectorCollector- 
You look boring. What are you selling today?
Just as exciting asleep as he is awake.

Pig EruditeErudite- 
Any of this magic stuff burn things?
Well, that's rude.

Pig FarmerFarmer- 
I didn't know pigs did farm work.
What a lazy pig!

Pig FloristFlorist- 
Can I burn your stuff?
She's asleep.

Pig HatmakerHatmaker- 
That hat is ugly.
She doesn't even take off her hat to sleep.

Pig HunterHunter- 
Fire is the best weapon.
Huh. Completely defenseless like that.

Pig MayorMayor Truffleston- 
Pigs have mayors?
He's dozing.

Pig MinerMiner- 
Yeah, he looks like a miner.
Dreaming of rocks, no doubt.

Pig ProfessorProfessor- 
A lot of old stuff in here.
Someone check for a pulse.

Pig QueenPig Queen- 
Hey there, your majesty.

Pig QueenPig Queen (dead)- 

Pig ShopkeepShopkeep- 
I bet their life is super boring.
Asleep. Figures.

Pig UsherUsher- 
How do you see through those glasses?
Who sleeps on the street?

Pig WorkerWorker- 
He fixes machines.
He's dozing.

KingfisherKingfisher (normal and held)- 
What's wrong with your face?
I should catch it while its guard is down.
Ugly and dead.
Never seen a bird like that.
Demised.
Flying rats.
Sleeping flying rats.
Whoops.
Beat it, smelly beetle!
You better run.
How do you sleep with that smell?
Squashed.
Looks slimy.
Yeesh, he’s sucking up all the gold!
Jeepers peepers!
A bush. I think.
I wonder what burning feathers smell like.
Very dead.
Fancy feathers.
Squirrelly little guy.
I bet I could catch it now.
Didn't run fast enough.
It likes lightning like I like fire.
Funny little feather.
Evil bird! Get away from those yummy berries!
The fire made this plant guy a lot quieter.
Ew.
It's too wet to burn.
It's still too wet to burn.
What's your angle?
If it kicks the bucket I'm outta here.
You still breathing? Just checking.
Is that infectious? We should burn it.
Canary feather. It probably smells terrible on fire.
She's... perfect.
My own little burninator.
I think she wants some burnings.
I can see her ribs!
I think a fire is trying to escape.
That egg looks happy.
It has a chill.
I hope she's not a biter.
Aw, it lost its fiery personality.
I wish everyone'd stop fawning over that smelly thing!
Don't think that horn makes you special, deer.
It's a big, weird antler.
A bird! I wonder if it's tasty.
Haha, I got you.
I bet I could sneak up on it now.
I wanna roast it!
It keeps squirming.
It's snoring.
Ew, it's dead.
Hey, come back here!
Got you now.
I don't think it wants to be friends.
That egg could use some fire!
The nest is empty.
Does it like fire?
Fire makes them so much better.
Arise my phoenix!
Ugh. Crunchy.
Is there such a thing as too much fire?
Needs more fire!
How long is this going to take?
I'm getting tired of waiting.
Not quite a phoenix but still cute, I guess.
Are you hungry?
Okay, okay! I get it, you're hungry.
I feel like he understands me.
He sure eats a lot.
Don't look at me! Get your own food.
No! Bad birdy!
Arise, my phoenix!
Not quite a phoenix, but still cute. I guess.
I feel like he understands.
He looks flammable!
Kill it with fire!
Who's your mommy!
Holy crap!
Stop staring at me!
Poor thing. Trapped in this maze.
I wonder if these rings are an indication of age.
Whoa! Niiiice bear...
It's fur all the way down.
What in the world...
It's huuuuge!
Its feathers are frazzled.
So snuggly!
It's filled with fire!
Oooooooh! I LIKE these.
The coolest drool!
Cool drool, literally.
I don't like you. You don't like me.
Kill it with fire!
Eww, stay away!
Don't mind if I do.
Never stick your beak where it doesn't belong.
Stay away from my precious flames!
That's what I thought!
I've been burned by cute things before.
What do these do?
Mysterious power emanates from it...
My nightmares have come true!
Don't look at me like that!
Guess it doesn't need to breathe with these anymore...
I'm gonna set it on fire!
Haha. I have its bone.
Not sorry about this at all.
Ha! That's what you get!
Ugh. Ugly.
I think it suits me.
What's he all about.
It's from that apocalypse jerk.
Hey! Burning is my thing!
Are you supposed to be special or something?
You'll burn like the rest!
I wonder if the rings are an indication of age.
Oooooooh! I LIKE those.
Ugh, it smells like bird butts!
No amount of honey is worth THAT!
That bee's head looks kinda tasty, doesn't it?
A lump of coal would be really useful, actually!
Why couldn't it just stay dead?!
Ha! I wouldn't wanna get smacked with that thing!
A mutant mushroom! I want it!
It's a hole, what do you want from me?
What is that? It's smelly.
It's covered in nasty warts and fungus!!
Woah! It's packing a punch now!
A big gross mushroom! Burn it!
She's gonna blow!
Ew! Burn that!
I brought you back so I could beat you up!
Gross, ew! Bones!
Hey! That's not fair!
Yuck, it's barely even alive.
Can't hit me in this thing!
I've got a headache just looking at it.
It smells like burnt hair!
Awww! I liked that thing.
He's so condescending.
Blech. What a slob.
He's trapped by those mean statues!
So, what happened to you?
What in the world!
Fancy monkey.
He looks kinda dozy.
Creepy little lizard.
A little too pecky for me.
That would look good barbequed.
That's a big bird butt.
Why didn't anyone tell me I had ashes on my face?
What do you want?!
You're in a good mood.
There's gonna be tremors in our future.
Yuck. It smells like sulfur.
I didn't wanna walk, anyway.
Burn it!
Buuurn!
I can't believe that worked!
See? Fire solves everything.
It feels like they're speaking inside my head!
Hi %s!
Why, %s... that fire in your eyes!
Hey %s! Your hair is dumb! Raaaugh!
%s won't leave anyone behind.
I better get a heart for %s.

Your fires are so cute, %s!
Hi %s!

Nice fire, %s!
Hi %s!

Monster! Murderer! BURN!
I guess %s isn't all mischief.
You're looking a little pale there, red.
Haha, YES! %s!!
Hi %s!

Heh, attagirl!'
Hi %s!
Why, %s... that fire in your eyes!
Burn the murderer!
Who do ghosts call? %s!
I better get a heart for %s.
BUUURN!
It smells like a bird's butt.
Yuck. The yellow part is all runny.
I could make this better with FIRE!
I've tasted better.
Chewy, but satisfying.
I'll need more than appetizers if I'm going to survive.
Gross. It's full of hairs.
It's still gross.
It's dry and smells strange.
Eww, it's all slimy.
Fire makes everything better.
Bang on the drum all day!
Do I satisfy my hunger or do I bang on the drum?
Slippery fishy!
Less slippery now that it's found fire.
I don't like the look it's giving me!
Fire improves everything.
Well, part of him is still cuddly.
It's so soft and squishy!
I'm still not sure I want to eat this.
It still twitches every now and then. Freaky.
The fire made it stop twitching. Fire is the best.
Yuck!
Still yuck!
Time to chuck it in the fire!
Ugh, fire would get rid of that smell.
Such pretty colors.
He lived a good life.
It actually looks edible.
It's still moving.
I wonder if the colors add flavor.
Looks chewy.
Needs... fire!
Aw, but I like mine with Ballphin!
It actually looks kinda edible.
I like sushi, but I prefer flame-broiled.
Fish and fire go well together.
A little lick of flame and you'll be tasty.
Pretty good!
Open up, fella.
The fire opens their shell.
Ughh! That's nasty!!
I cooked them, but they're still nasty.
Is living underwater as awful as it sounds?
The fire got rid of most of the fish smell.
Found you!
I burned it just right.
You look kinda dumb.
Fire burned the grossest bits right off.
The fin fell off.
You should cook up nicely.
Lobster for dinner! Pinch me!
Parenting is gross.
Nothing like a hot meal.
I'm not sure I should eat that.
Only one way to find out if it's still poison...
Ugh!
The fire did nothing to make it more appetizing.
This could be made better with FIRE!
Unseasoned meat... great.
Gonna need a lot of appetizers to survive out here!
Hmm... Satisfy hunger, or bang on the drum?
It still doesn't look totally edible.
Just a dumb little fish.
What the-? It's so small!
Hey! I thought you were gonna be a big fish!
Looks more like a shrimp to me.
Weird...
Ew, that thing looks nasty!
Quit looking at me like that!
What's so dandy about it?
Ha! I'm not scared of a little bad luck.
What... is it?
Red berries taste the best.
Red berries with fire somehow taste even better.
Bananas!
Yum!
It looks sort of like a fire!
It looks more like a fruit that's been in a fire now.
Ew, stinky!
Yuck, it smells just as bad cooked!
Is it supposed to have this many parts?
Fire always makes things better.
I once knew a melon named Walter. He was a jerk.
Warm, sweet, juicy Walter.
Bananas!
Yum!
An edible tree thing.
Aha! Now you're food!
Mmmm, toasty.
These could use fire.
Ahhh the aroma.
Mmm. They pop in your mouth.
Fire improves everything.
Yuck. It's all vegetabley.
Still vegetabley, but better for having been in fire.
A sweet vegetable, yum!
Ooh, this one explodes when it goes in fire!
Definitely not a bird.
Using fire on it made it a tastier eggplant.
I wonder what will happen if I apply fire.
Fire on the outside turned out pretty well.
I like the color.
Boring!
It smells like a gym sock!
I changed it with fire!
Light without fire. Unnatural.
Blah, tastes like sawdust.
It still looks dangerous.
It seems fine now.
Yet another flower.
Soggy sea grass.
Not bad once you add fire.
Healthy jerky.
It would be cuter on fire!
A welcome change from red berries.
The flames definitely improved it.
Gross. It's all gooey inside.
I put fire on it.
They're all chewy like this. They need fire.
Not so chewy now, are you?
Eww. That does not look appetizing.
Still gross!
Just a dumb flower.
Fire makes it better.
It smells funny.
Like little balls of fire.
Spicy. Like fire for your mouth.
Should be ripe before I burn it.
Fire it always makes it better.
The flower means it's ripe.
Aw. The flower didn't even burn.
It's been transformed by fire!
Transformed by fire!
It feels like grandma's hands.
HEY! Who dares me to eat it raw?
Great, now I don't have to chew.
It's not half bad.
I bet it'll taste good when it's ripe.
It's ripe!
I like it with just a pinch of fire.
It's just a couple cloves of garlic.
Fire made it better.
It's so bulbous.
Roasting. My favorite cooking method.
Good. These are the hot ones.
First rule of vegetables: fire makes it better.
We grew it in that gross muck.
Cooking just means sticking stuff in fire.
Cutting these is a pain.
It just needed a couple minutes on the fire.
The yellow mucus-y part is gross, but the bacon is great!
Heehee, look at that butterfly stuck in the muffin.
Fire fruit in a pie? Oh boy!
What you see is what you get. Sticks of fish.
Convenient taco-grip.
Wham, bam, jam! Thank you, ma'am.
Maybe I won't notice that it's frog legs in the sandwich.
Yum, fruit!
Fire, ham and honey go well together.
Honey-covered morsels that have met my friend, fire.
Meat and fire, now with a stick!
Blending it into a soup got rid of its face.
Meat made into spheres and improved with fire.
Just add fire to food and voila!
Noodles, meat and clumps of hair. Nasty.
Tasty things sealed with fire.
I wonder if it is flammable.
Cookies!!!
Vegetables. So many vegetables.
It's still not a bird, but I stuffed it like one!
Sugary things burn great, but I should eat this instead.
A feast of burned bird!
I cooked that.
Hi, waffles!
How did it go wrong?! I put it in fire and everything.
I'd rather a bowl of flames.
Holy moley, that's tasty!
Well, soooometimes cold things are okay.
Why would you freeze a fruit when you could burn it?
Now that's my kind of heat!
Crunch crunch crunch.
This is the opposite of burning.
I guess I could eat that.
Oh goody. Fish rolled in seaweed.
It's still slimy.
I suddenly feel motivated.
I want twenty!
I'm gonna eat this entire thing!
Yummmmmmm!
Ew, what IS this?
And I didn't even burn it!
Ugh. This is old person food!
Ooo la la.
Gross!
Mmm, smells good!
Cooked to perfection!
Fish eggs in a jar. Great.
Ughh, is there anything besides fish out here??
Even water and vegetables taste better with fire.
Ha! Now I can eat those jerk bugs.
Little chewier than normal cakes.
I like the crunchy part.
I prefer hot things.
It clears my snot.
Water and bones are better with fire.
Fire for my tongue.
It's a ham sandwich.
Fire makes everything better.
If you close your eyes it's a little easier to get it down.
The face doesn't wash away!!
It's still not a bird, but it's sure stuffed like one!
Sugary things burn great, but best not waste food.
You can make it fancy but it's still an eel.
How did it go wrong?! It was engulfed in fire and everything.
Nothing better than a handful of jellybeans.
I would practically INHALE that!
I can't wait to eat it.
Woah, that's a ton of frogs.
I prefer hot food.
That's definitely going in my mouth.
I LOVE mashed potatoes.
It looks soooo good!
I'm sure he wouldn't mind if I stole a nibble.
My mouth is on fire!
MY stuff never comes out looking like THIS!
Woah, I didn't know potatoes came in that shape!
Hey, this is great!
HEY WARLY! Can I eat this?
Farming is boring.
Seeds for a yucky orange vegetable.
Seeds for my favorite explosive vegetable.
Seeds for that fire-looking fruit.
Smelly seeds for a smelly fruit.
Will these seeds make a plant or baby bird?
A tiny seed. Looks like the parts inside the fruit.
Seeds for the best vegetable-friend of fire: pumpkin.
No good for farming now.
Sweet and delicious!
No more flying for that butterfly!
Tasty, and just a little bit insecty.
At least it's still flammable.
Ew! Why? Oh Why?!
Gross! Let's burn it.
Looks like you won't become a tree after all.
It's fuzzy with electricity. Yuck.
I could grow them, but that sounds boring.
I bet this burns bright!
I could learn to love the taste...
Seeds. Sweet.
I bet I could burn those.
I set it on fire so now I can eat it.
Looks like kindling.
Is this even good for anything?
It should really be a flame.
Should I plant this?
This'll make some food.
Ugh! Why can't this just be food already?!

Don't Starve Together
Pumpkin SeedsPumpkin Seeds- 
Seeds for fire's best vegetable-friend... the pumpkin.
It's so sweet!
It's just a bunch of seeds.
It's just a bunch of seeds.
It's just a bunch of seeds.
It's just a bunch of seeds.
It's just a bunch of seeds.
This will save some experimentation.
These must make them move.
Leftovers from a fire. I wish it was still here.
I wish this thing was still burning, whatever it was.
So pretty!
Ugh. This one is ugly.
It sparkles.
This one feels really light.
This one makes my fingers tingle.
Uh, where did this come from?
Ew. Nasty. But useful.
It burns like normal poop.
I'll bet the fire that melted these was fiercely hot.
A cheap fake. It probably doesn't even burn properly.
The knot is stuck. Who needs a knife when you've got fire?
He looks like he was forged in flame.
Check out those tiny thrusters. Such explosive power!
Not even a spark.
Fire is more fun.
I've never liked bathing with water.
You can strike a match on a zipper, but not on buttons.
I don't think dentures don't burn well.

All dried up, as if it stayed a bit too close to the fire.

I don't have any pins...
Oh, this would burn.
Litter is a terrible thing.
I wonder if this is worth anything?
Brain cloud? Sounds tragic.
Where's my lighter...
Broken what?
Sooo shiny.
Not my style.
I can't say that word!
I've put away childish things...
No idea...
Another key.
A key to what?
Something must be locked up somewhere.
You'd have to have a tiny little head to fit this.
Some sort of weird coin.
Maybe it's worth something?
I have money to burn!
Less fun way of burning the city down.
Its grin creeps me out.
It's really old.
Snooty.
Looks fancier than those other old things.
Ugh. Can't get those jewels out.
Ughhh, it stinks!
Fire makes everything better.
Bug skin.
Zoom!
My own house to burn to the ground.
This means everyone has to listen to me.
I just have to find out what it locks.
A whole city of my own to burn down!
Looks kinda bossy.
Who would want that?
Hehe. It's so silly.
Clean up your gross hair guys! Ugh!
It'll make your fingers tingle.
That’s how you play marbles, right? By burning them?
These wires get WX all frazzled. Heh heh.
Spinning the stick in the hole could start a fire. Thanks Girl Scouts!
Cute as Wendy's lil nose.
Hey Maxwell, I think you dropped these!
I bet Wilson would enjoy dissecting this.
Looks flammable.
Ugh, it's weird!
Burning is still an option.
It's burning a hole in my pocket. Heh.
I don't want to mess with that.
We could be good friends, you and I.
I could fill them with flammable gas.
That's just asking to be popped.
Would make a great bedtime story... for nightmares!
Woah. It doesn't burn!!
Black and white and fuzzy all over!
Trading diagrams is for dorks.
Who even reads fishing magazines? Uh, apart from me right now...

They put a bird on it.
What is it with megalomaniacs and chess?
Metal bends when it gets nice and hot.

Useful only for kindling.
This looks a little like a fire iron.
When I crank it Wes pretends to ride unicycle circles around me.
I could use this as a very long fuse...
It looks like it might melt in a fire.
Probably the most boring game ever invented.
I don't want Ms. Wickerbottom to be sad. Let's burn it!
I stuck one down Wolfgang's unitard when he wasn't looking. Haha.
I would have roasted it.
Chess is for pompous dorks.
I want to stick it in a fire!
That's not an eyeball! It's a rock!
A big dumb rock.
This one's got fire in its eye!
It's a rock. Ugh!
Some sort of weird rock.
Another rock!
It's glittery and mesmerizing, like a fire!
Gotta hold it with my sleeve so my hands don't get cold.
Boo! Hissss!
Buncha junk.
There's something inside.
You win THIS time, Maxwell.

It's making some kind of noise.
This thing is getting noisier.
I must be close!
Gah! Enough with the beeping!
Not sure what this does. Doesn't seem like it's fiery things.
Just needs to be unlocked with a key. Not fire, unfortunately.
It's whirring now!
Maybe that leads home.
I like more exciting music.
These are no fun. They light themselves.
I'm beginning to dislike that man.
What kind of jerk leaves this lying around?

Sick Worm HoleSick Worm Hole- 
Yuck. That won't hold long.

I can't sleep when there's a great ball of fire to stare at.
Too spooky down here to sleep.
My tummy is grumbling, I can't sleep!
No time for sleep, there's fighting to do!
It's busyyyy.
They won't fully appreciate my gift.
Not right now. It's sleeping.
It looks slightly happier.
Show yourself!
That sounded like a big mean monster man!
I can't carry any more stuff!
I can only carry so much!!
Make someone else do it!
It's full already.
They won't let me.

Maybe I should wait for it to be distracted...
I can't write on it.
I'll ride it when it settles down.
I can't place anything from atop this big lout!
Yum!
That was kinda gross.
That tasted terrible!
Ugh! Nasty!
I need food!
Aah!
My precious light is gone!
Ouch!
I think I can fix this!
That sound probably doesn't mean good things.
I'm safe from the sky-fire.
The heat is too intense!
You're good for something besides burning after all.
Uh oh!
This could be bad!
I hate it!
Ugh, this is the WORST!
Still got my lighter!
Hooray, it's about to light on fire!
I wish I'd let it go up in flames...
That sounded like a big mean monster man!
It's just the collapsing that concerns me.
That sound probably doesn't mean good things.
The fiery mountain speaks!
Hey, stop splashing around out there!
Show yourself!
That sounded like a big mean monster man!
That fog looks pretty dense.
Uh oh. Which way was I going again?
I couldn't see a thing in there!
Weeee!
I'm going down!
My boat is wounded!
I think I sprung a leak.
My trawl is ready to reel in.
Shoot! It got away!

Life brings pain, pain brings life.
The clouds weep.
North.
North. No wait, South.
East.
West.
Northeast.
Southeast.
Northwest.
Southwest.
I am directionless.
Abigail always helped me tie the bow.
I can't wrap nothingness...
I don't even remember what's within anymore...
It won't insulate me from the horrors of this world.
That'll make quite a draft.
A siesta is but a preview of death.
I'd really rather be in a tent.
I couldn't possibly nap. Death is nigh.
My stomach is as empty as my heart, I can't nap now.
The sun upsets me. I couldn't possibly sleep
A preview of the fires of Hell.
There it sits, just taking up space.
Frozen like my heart.
Just a moderately cold lump of rock.
As lukewarm and lifeless as every other rock.
Those that burn brightest, burn fastest.
The sun beats down.
I was always destined to bear a heavy load.
This should help me carry more junk.
It slows the rot and decay of death.
That'll make quite a draft.
It makes me feel less alone. Plus I can throw it.
The sun beats down.
A potion to stave off the sickness.
A welcome respite.
For murdering bugs.
Do you enjoy the wistful sound of bird song, Abigail?
A spacious sack to increase one's burden.
With this the fishies will be ripped from the safety of their precious pond.
For veiling oneself in the fuzzy skins of the fallen.
There's no salve for the pain of existence.
Nothing can insulate us from the horrors of this world.
Choices matter.
We were not meant to cheat death.
At any moment it could pop and spill its guts.
When I am still, it is as lifeless as Abigail.
Why? No one will come.
He's had a rough life.
He dances to forget the pain.
Wow... What a big stuffy.
He has passed.
To fend off the ravages of decay... for my food at least.
Empty as my soul.
Whatever is in there isn't dead yet.
It needs to boil.
Finally, food.
That can't go in there.
They shall labor so I can steal.
Work, bees!
Toil on.
Their toils have been fruitful!
What seeds shall I sow?
Take your time, I'll wait.
It's ready for the harvest.
This earth is cold and dead.
It is as cold as my heart.
I can hang meat here.
It sways in the drying wind.
The drying is over.
Burnt to a crisp.
Burnt honey.
This earth is burnt and dead.
The rain is keeping it from drying.
It's done drying forever.
A bucket of grime.
The mussels cling to this stick. Fools.
They yearn for the deep.
Life can't come from nothing... I need something...
Life needs time to blossom.
Look, Abby. We have a visitor.
Abby... There's more now...
Do they know I'm watching?
They shall never taste freedom.
It cannot water my parched soul.
Their stolen labor tastes so sweet.
Leafy tendrils coil out of the muck.
It's done drying. Forever.
Emptiness. The natural state of all things.
The beginnings of life...
It thrives... against all odds...
Completely teeming with life...
Nothing escapes the pull of decay.
It is no more.
A frigid cold bites at its heart.
For when the hunger gnaws at my tiny stomach...
Another menial task has been completed.
Inflicts chaos and turmoil on food.
If only it could spice up my life.
Finished.
I will learn unspeakable things.
Why do I feel that it is measuring my mortality?
It measures cloudiness. I like it when it's dreary.
Focuses the destruction.
Even this power will run out.
It is a dark path I tread.
It's unspeakably burnt to the ground.
Does that mean my day to die is here?
Does that mean sunshine is dead, too?
Quiet as a corpse.
I don't know why you bother. We're all going to burn.
It's running on fumes.
Electrical doo-what?
Do I dare plumb the sea's dark knowledge?
My heart makes ice too.
It's in great shape.
It's feeling okay.
It seems a little depressed.
It's running on fumes.
It gave up.
Corruption spills forth from the depths.
It blazes with more passion than I know.
Alas the relief it brings is only temporary.
It is unspeakably burnt.
Why do I feel that it is measuring our mortality?
It is a dark path we tread.
Maps are best with monsters drawn on the borders.
Well, old maps always do look burnt at the edges...
No more mapmaking, then.
That looks... f-fun...
...I can't be disapointed... If I expect nothing...
I think that's... wrong...
Abigail... You be death, I'll be the Sculptor...
There's no room...
Cleft from the stone.
Oh... my information's useless...
Thinking on the waves makes me nauseous.
Another entry in a long line of unfortunate occurrences.
I've never much cared for metaphor.
I have become the destroyer of worlds.
Death begets death.
Death returns to the sender.
OW! That was karma.
I blow in this end and pain comes out the other end.
Not even the big sleep, just a temporary one.
Shall I burn down the world?
A dead thing for me to wear. Goody.
I prolong the inevitable.
I might hold off the inevitable a bit longer with this.
Stops the daggers that stab at mine heart.
They're still alive in there. Poor things.
A devious surprise from underground.
It deserved it.
I'd like to wear it inside-out.
Danger in the dark.
Some weather out there.
One jab and they'll be retching.
Send ill will with a whisper.
I hold someone's explosive death in my hands.
Fire in the hole!
Why throw a spear when you can shoot it?
With this corpse sword I shall make another.
Dashing.
Armor made of the homes of dead goo.
Heavy...
It makes me as prickly outside as I am inside!
A terrible weapon for a terrible world.
Another instrument of death.
Something died so that this armor may exist.
The mind that dwelt within is long gone.
As hollow as my heart.
It'll protect my head but not my heart.
Like a metal coffin that keeps me alive.
An instrument of death.
They who wield it shall become the destroyer of worlds.
Blow in one end, pain comes out the other.
Shall we set the world on fire?
To prolong the inevitable.
To hold off the inevitable a bit longer.
Could stop the daggers that stab at mine heart.
It seems a tad dramatic.
I've never seen her take it off before...
Airborne lightning and death.
It only provides the illusion of control.
Sickly spores bring such sweet slumber.
I'm protected, but at what cost to my dignity.
Some of us can see our cages.
He is happier now.
Is he dead? No. Just sleeping.
At least they are comfortable.
I hope he is enjoying himself.
Now I'm all alone.
It is not as edible as it looks.
Their defensive value is questionable.
That is the mere suggestion of defense.
Bundled logs.
Now I can delay the inevitable.
These won't protect from the demons within.
What will protect me from what's inside?
For which to contain my lucre.
A mark is made, however transient.
Its growth is stunted by the limits of the pot.
We must stick it in the cold, hard ground...
It is bare...
I draw better with references...
Such a striking likeness...
We could use it to build a fence.
Sort of like an emotional barrier. But wood.
We could use it to build a gate.
Will it keep others in, or out?
Nothing lasts forever.
It didn't cook well.
Defenses down.
The inevitable is coming.
It couldn't even hold ashes.
Boom box.
Transient, indeed.
Its beauty will undoubtedly succumb to the tide.
If only molding the sands of time were so easy.
Hopefully they won't invite me in.
Looks filthy.
A wall made of living coral... well, no longer.
A wall of dead things to hold back life.
Cruel hearts dwell within.
A bag of dirt I can carry.
They hold back ruin. For a time...
Curiouser and curiouser.
Like my beloved sister, I can never return.
Float on, little friend.
Treasures suspended over the bottomless abyss.
A wretched den of joviality.
It would be more useful if I placed it.
Slimy on top.
Can I fill it with my soul?

Don't Starve Together
BirdcageBirdcage (occupied, sleeping)- 
Dead? No. Just sleeping.
Always on the outside, looking in.
It will only delay the inevitable.
Must be hungry.
The emptiness is consuming him.
Bereft of life, it rests in peace.
That... is an ex-bird.
Its blank face shall soon offer a secret.
Its blank face shall soon bear a secret.
Transient, indeed.
The shadow equivalent of taxidermy. I like it.
We pulled the flowers from their homes for our own amusement.
It's illuminating... for now.
It, too, will die.
I think it's lovelier this way...
Nothing lasts forever.
Who would want to scare crows away?
Antagonizing crows is always bad luck.
Now the crows will be at peace.
This gift from above should not go to waste.
The moon... she whispers promises of protection to me.
No need to lean in and check if it's hot. I can feel it from here.
It reminds me of a story I used to read with Abigail.
Soon it will be nothing but ashes.
Now it doesn't remind me of anything.
What's the point.
I guess I won't be changing again anytime soon.
I'd like to use that after you. If you don't mind, I mean.
This gilded cage is ceramic.
'The Frogs Who Desired a King'...
DIY Royalty Kit BurntDIY Royalty Kit (burnt)- 
Their kingdom vanishes as swiftly as it appeared.
I don't know why you bother.
All that work, for nothing.
That would be the easy way out of this place.
Even scarier for the trees.
The better to mark graves with.
For documenting my pain.
Purple like a... purple thing.
With the sleep of dreams comes this stuff.
It's useless on its own, just like me.
It feels so... nostalgic.
I wonder if the bamboo finds this new form agreeable?
When coral dies it hardens to stone.
Empty. Like my soul.
Bare and completely devoid of life.
It'll never get better than this.
It's useless and missing a piece, much like me.
Cold... but not lifeless...
My fingers ache from sewing in all those feathers.
I'm just putting off the inevitable.
This is but a step from madness.
I have learnt unspeakable things.
Music is the window to my empty soul.
Eerie and yet beautiful.
A perfectly safe way to go insane.
Dreams come to a point. A sharp one.
I used to take such joy in instruments like these.
An enchanted weapon. How exciting!
A clinging, dreary, living suit.
A familiar chilling embrace.
It's oozing.
I wonder who used to own this.
I could set the world on fire!
A staff to freeze.
I could escape if it were more powerful.
Energy flows through it.
The focus is so lifeless.
The gem has focused it.
It looks so empty.
I'm glad that fail-safe is gone.
Madness brings fire.
It's unspeakably burnt to the ground.
Ring in the dead.
I don't know what this is.
Whatever it was, it's burnt now.
That I might play a tune to soothe my troubled heart.
More forgotten knowlege.

Pugalisk WandPugalisk Wand- 
It penetrates into the soul.
Another world, another hardship.
Shall I leave this mortal coil?
A death machine has been given life.
Saves my possessions. But it can't save my heart.
The depths of its darkness is unending.
It's just putting off the inevitable.
The world will burn before this staff.
We could escape if it were more powerful.
It is unspeakably burnt.
Grant us the power of sight...
Does it reflect from the other side too, Abigail?
A new moon looms above us.
The moon waxes before us.
A full moon looms overhead. Watchful.
The moon is on the wane.
Caves. The moon's one weakness.
For when I don't want to be alone...
The way is clear.
A small wooden reminder of Woodie's cursed existence.
That is deeply disturbing.
I don't want to play with that.
Another implement for putting off inevitable decay.
Their bitter end protects me from the bitter cold.
I shall cover my head.
This will protect me from those happy buzzing sounds. Oh, and the stings.
Ca-caw!
It helps stave off the encroaching cold.
I can wear pieces of dead things made into a vest!
Skin to wear on my skin.
It may warm my body, but what of my spirit?
I'm already practically invisible...
But I am in mourning...
I can get nowhere faster.
Nothing like the stench of death on my head.
It's sticky on my head. Yuck.
Keep a cool head.
I liked jumping in puddles with Abigail.
What fun is rain if you're not getting wet?
Everything's a vest.
They'll put flowers on anything these days.
That's one stretchy eye.
Death surrounds me. Well, my torso anyhow.
Does this make my brain look big?
A hat made of trophies taken from the dead!
A jacket of dead flesh. Fashionable.
Disturbing, but cozy.
The wind's tendrils cannot hold me!
To make my outside match my inside.
This hat prevents breathing in death.
I cut through the air!
Chic, yet fearsome.
This seems excessive.
It keeps out the gas, but not the despair.
As hard as my existence.
Pretty.
Their bitter end offers protection from the bitter cold.
When the sun beats mercilessly, life finds a way. Ugh.
To cover one's head.
A piece of finery to help forget the inescapable wild.
Pieces of dead things, made into a vest!
Skin to wear over your skin.
It may warm the body, but what of my spirit?
To explore to the ends of this wretched world.
Nothing like the stench of death on your head.
It makes the wearer's head sticky. Yuck.
Death surrounds us. Well, our torsos anyhow.
They're just for show.
Now no one can tell when I'm crying.
If I'm lucky, it'll be poisonous.
The strands are so slippery, it's barely holding together.
We all hide behind our own masks...
Its presence marks the edge of the unknown.
Are the very stones haunted?
These didn't protect the ancients did they!
I know not what lurks in the shadow.
I can feel the prying eyes.
They approach.
They're all around me!
I think they're leaving.
It's almost over.
I am alone.
Temporary release from drudgery.
A brief light in my dark life.
A flash of brilliance!
Each time I use it I die and am reborn.
The stick is as twisted as my soul.
I can see the power sparkle deep within.
An item with multiple uses.
Abigail would've loved this crown.
A reprieve from death.
I hold the power of the ancients in my hands.
I think I need to place it.
I do not know why it helps me.
These didn't protect the ancients, now did they!
They're all around!
The presence has departed.
A brief light in a dark life.
With each use the wielder dies and is reborn.
I can see the power sparkling deep within.
It possesses the power of the ancients.
I think it needs to be placed.
This looks heavy, slow and dangerous.
Maybe if I ride this upon the waves I shall be joined with my sister.
I wonder how many leagues this can convey me?
This transports more junk... to nowhere.
A boat that can take a bite or two.
A vessel of aquatic death.
A seaworthy vessel if ever there was one!
I guess this could save a boat from destruction. And me with it.
Harness the wind and fly to... nowhere.
With sail in hand I shall beat a hasty escape. But to where?
Gross, but efficient.
Those dumb birds sure make a speedy sail.
If I'm lucky I'll sail off the edge of the earth.
It brings low death to the high seas!
I can be assertive, when need be.
Come, creatures of the sea! Enjoy a lovely snack!
Decay will surely come for my ships now.
It wards off the inevitable decay.
It is close to giving up, just like me.
It's off...
It is pulling sludge from the depths.
It won't last much longer. Me neither.
A way to wrest items from the sea's grip.
What creatures will this wrest from the ocean?
It's started its journey into the depths.
Its journey is almost at an end.
I can spy to the horizon and see more... nothing.
I can see so much more useless nothing.
No living soul commands the sea...
That hat of a cutthroat killer. I like it.
Haughty seadog couture.
I'd prefer a dry grave, thank you.
I only hope when it sinks, the end will be quick.
A blade that bites and burns.
Cuts and burns.
Jabbing with fire.
Is it wise to don a suit of fire stone?
The tree's children will raze the world.
A terrifying force of nature contained within a delicate shell.
It's... a stick.
The fiery breath of the volcano is mine to command!
I can outsmart the death traps!
For delicate smashing.
Offers too much hope.
For a closer look at life's horrors.

Lamp Post (on)- 
It cannot ward off the darkness forever.
Shelter won't save you from death.

The Sterling Trough Deli- 
Food for my belly but not my soul.
Contains things to sustain this empty life.
It brings me no comfort.
Could these goods fill the emptiness within me?
Plants wither and die too.
I myself am an oddity.
Can any of this magic bring back Abigail?
Agents of death.
Hats cannot cure my melancholy.
A monument to things long dead.
A fruitless attempt to make change in this world.
Everything I build will be destroyed one day.
Power corrupts.
Power has corrupted me.
I can now hire protection, but why bother.

Slanty Shanty BuildSlanty Shanty (owned)- 
Why bother with a permanent home?
I bet one could see impending doom from there.

Don't Starve Together
Map ScrollMap Scroll (Cave)Map Scroll (empty)- 
Blank as Abigail now.
Cursed with nine lives. Poor thing.
Blissfully unaware of mortal troubles...
The softest creature in the hardest world.
My, what big eyes you have.
Its snuggles almost make me forget.
It's so happy.
Your beauty will fade too, you know.
A cold mockery.
A bubble, frozen in time, can never pop.
We are all but pawns in this game called 
A mere minion to something greater.
Oh, if I could ride away into the night.
A piece, constrained to the board.
They're here.
She holds the true power, here.
Alas, the king is but a figurehead, at best.
What terrible beast.
Ashes to ashes, bust to bust. Oh.
Such expression in her eyes.
She now lies, cold as stone.
But a simulacrum of life. Sigh.
Why did we sculpt an anchor.
I'd prefer to look at this over the real thing.
A lifeless sacrifice.
Shall I even bother building this?
Death is so anticlimactic for trees.
It visits death upon all who face it.
To mask the smell of sorrow and death.
It's for making a boat.
I'd prefer to be stranded at sea.
Just when it thought it had escaped the ocean...
To mend what the cruel seas have crushed.
It's for a burdensome boat anchor.
It's for making a mast.

Steering Wheel KitSteering Wheel Kit- 
It would make a steering wheel...
Reading is a dangerous thing.
Will it teach me how to fly away from here?
Imagine, a rolling field of red flowers...
Does it impart an eternal slumber?
The tome to end it all...
Does this world need more beasts?
It doesn't mend the hole... merely masks it.
It visits death upon intruders.
It's dead...
Oh no...
It all crumbles to ash, in the end.
But what if I liked the dark?
It's a kind of electrical box.
It's not long for this world.
What did Winona put in it again? Oh...
This one looks odd.
It's slowly dying.
I think it wants... gems...
So my outside matches my inside.
To prick and ensnare.
It's poop. Sigh.
It's smell is good for keeping people at a distance.
Not as sweet as Abigail.
Full of more vitality than I'm used to.
For rubbing into wounds.
It's for putting nice things in...
Oh... it's... g-good.
The most delicious lie.
Nine lives are not enough to save you from my hungry maw...
You have to bite their heads off first... heehee...
This is... fun...
Don't worry, Webber, it's just candy.
As perplexing as it is delicious.
Sigh. At least it's honest.
Life is a swirling abyss of suffering and disappointment.
Lumps of bitter sorrow.
Today I eat them. One day, they'll eat me.
A candy as hard as my heart.
What is this eternal burning?!
Drive it through my heart and be done.
When I gaze into the ball I see... nothing. Apropos.
Neither half empty, nor half full.
Now Webber and I can match.
Perhaps a curse could end our suffering.
It's very fetching.
It makes the world look as insignificant as I feel.
One lonely half of a pair.
The weight of the world rests upon me.
It looks like ectoplasm in there.
To frolic, to play, no more.
I have put childish things behind me.
Some breaks cannot be mended.
It is so colorful...
I simply do not know what is it.
Madness lies within.
Things seem less horrifying with this.
If only life was so potent.
Like life, it's a bit disappointing.
I wish I possessed such burning within my heart.

Totally Normal RootTotally Normal Root- 
Potential horror.
It'll grow up big and abhorrent.
It longs to be hung somewhere.
Crows in trees mean souls trapped between worlds.
It descends into darkness.
It reminds me of Abigail. I'll hang it somewhere.
Decoration for a devilish day.
A memorial for a monster.
Did you see that, Abigail?
Bats can't scare me anymore. I can return to my melancholy.
Abby...how do I make the ribbon curly?
The only gift I desire is a swift end...
We can plant a Winter's Feast tree.
Death comes for all of us...
It's not ready yet.
Oh, joy.
Oh.
I'm going to eat you.
It is made with chunks of evil.
Not nearly sweet enough to balance out this bitter world.
If you eat it right... the end gets sharp...
It tastes okay, but I've grown tired of logs...
I'm going to lick all the icing off...
I don't want Winter's Feast to end...
I missed cocoa.
So aggressively delicious. You can't help but feel better.
Do you like this one, Abigail?
Bright lights... Cold nights...
This is one of my favorites.
A remembrance of past carnage.
Should old acquaintance be forgot.
It hungers for a sacrifice.
It's empty...
Black like my heart.
What lies within?
Luck has long since abandoned me...
It needs only a light.
A light to guide me.
It's... surprisingly soft.
What big eyes you have.
The belly of the beast.
That's just a tall tail.
The hounds are baying.
We must light a fire to honor the hound.
Dust to dust.
That I cannot hear it does not mean it is silent.
My, what big teeth you have.
Naught but a pithy imitation of life.
To perish now would save me much sorrow.
There is no life in its eyes.
I think we could make what's drawn here...
Happiness is a warm puppy... but this one is cold.
It knows only fury.
A tribute to gluttony.
It needs a sacrifice of flesh.
Ashes to ashes.
Something died for that feast.
I don't want to eat that.
It'll keep me alive a little longer.
Yet another unnecessary plaything.
His whole career is grounded in violence.
Furious.
Petrifying.
A storm rages within him.
It's much too late for games.
Help me clean up, Abigail.
Danger lurks. There's no time for games.
A ruthless man.
A shame you have to perish.
Death will be a blessing.
You cannot shield yourself from this world.
Abigail will defend me.
You shall fall.
Your death will be swift.
Brotherly camaraderie will not save you.
You are a prisoner of your own doomed destiny.
I dared not hope it would take me home.
I bid you good day.
Empty as my heart.
Full as my sorrows.
That's where they come from...
That Battle Standard needs to be destroyed...
Webber seems proud of them.
When will you be free from this torment?
I could restore my allies.
To call death from the skies.
There is power in words.
I would not want such power.
What a brutal implement.
To cut and slash...
Such a brutal weapon...
Hello again, Lucy.
It's too heavy. Like my soul.
To pierce the hearts of my foes...
To burn and pierce!
A bombardment of pain.
If only my heart were as light.
They'll have to catch me to hurt me.
Protect my fragile frame.
Even our armor is fanged.
It will restore one's power.
Heavy protection for one's heart.
This world is nothing but hurt.
It protects from damage, but not from sorrow.
It brings more pain into the world.
Hit harder, stronger...
I forsee a wave of death.
But what of the birds?
I'll be able to attack so often...
There is dastardly power within.
The wearer shall be a force of good.
It eases pain of the body, but not of the heart.
But will it heal my soul?
You'll not glimpse death today...
All done.
Thank-you...
No... I don't want that...
Hello, ma'am. Care to trade?
What childhood is this for you?
How do you do?
How do you do, sir?
He is practicing for the big sleep.
They're less standoffish than their brethen.
Don't worry. You'll be dead soon.
Would you like to be a pie, little bird?
It's practicing for the big sleep.
Cold and dead.
Had I such a shell, I would never emerge.
It shall never grow another berry.
Wilson calls them 'greens'... but they're purple...
They thrive on a stump made by death.
All things die. Even fungus.
Time came for it.
We will perish before this grows back.
I suppose it could be edible.
We've taken all there was to take.
It has a sickly beauty.
All things must end.
Like a dagger through the heart. A tree heart.
I can harvest it now.
All that sacrifice for nothing.
Its life ebbs.
Like death, it creeps everywhere.
The monster's hunger shall never cease.
We have prolonged our horrific demise.
There's no night here. It is a nice change.
What horror have those eyes witnessed?
Yet another reminder of death.
It's been forgotten.
Nothing more to pray for.
This was once a happy home.
Its hearth no longer has a home.
Time is death's ally.
A door that leads nowhere.
The roof cannot protect you when death comes.
It's winged, but it's no angel.
Abigail needs a statue.
I see no joy in this house.
Neither a house nor a home.
Looks dangerous.
I need a key to enter.
Now I may enter the park.
I am ground down on the mealing stone of life.
Long dry.
A post. Not very exciting.
I am not impressed by opulence.
Seclusion has not been kind to it.
Let's have a peek inside...
Locked, like my heart.
I, too, cart around my baggage.
Nothing in there could bring me happiness.
Water, water, everywhere...
A monument. But not to Abigail.
It sheds light on nothing important.
The only light in my light is Abigail.
Time is an illusion.
Dust to dust.
Nothing escaped this plague.
It's for hanging the pot over the fire.
The hanger is a noose for a pot.
Sigh... Why bother?
It looks good.
It looks okay.
It only works if I place it somewhere.
It makes a little bit of food.
I don't want to carry this around.
It can't make life more palatable.
We will cook, or we will die.
We cook to stave off death.
For making a small amount of food.
For making food.
Sweetness begets sweetness.
It's for collecting salt from the pond.
There is no salt, yet.
There is salt to be had.
Life is a trap.
To till the corrupt soil.
Is all of life not a slaughter?
For collecting tree blood.
It is the key to something precious.
The key to a beautiful place, locked long away.
Perhaps I'll be happier in the next world.
Planting seeds requires an optimism I don't possess.
The life they contain is a mystery.
It flops as its life slowly leaves its body.
Not so lively now.
Its insides are as horrid as its outsides.
It's ready now.
Cooked purples.
Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll be poisonous.

GarlicGarlic- 
It gives food flavor.
It smells a bit nice.
I never cry.
It will never make anyone cry again.
It has eyes, yet it never cries.
Now its eyes will never open.
Red as heart's blood.
Its flesh is far more bloody now.
It's... a turnip.
The turnip is now cooked.
We can grind it down into flour.
Flour by any other name would smell as sweet.
But no honey.
It needs to be ground down before we can use it.
It adds flavor...
Tree blood.
As bittersweet as life.
Not as sweet as Abigail.
We ripped it from its home on the shrub.
Just a dash.
I shall put them on my eyes when I die.
Money will not bring back Abigail.
Wealth cannot buy immortality.
It came from above.
We should offer it to the beast.
The beast doesn't want that.
The beast will be satisfied with this.
This will satisfy the beast, but not for long.
A waste.
If only life had been handed to me on a silver plate.
It is empty, like my heart.
I can't open it without a key.
I've already put this on a dish.
Like my soul, this food doesn't belong in this vessel.
It hasn't yet eaten our last sacrifice...
That may not be best...
Should I give up, or find another key?
Someone's beat me to it.
Those foods weren't meant to be together.
It's ruined.
What a horrible place to have a curse.
Let us depart this terrible place.
Nature is so boring.
Its cycle of life is ending.
A tree that knows only pain.
Everything dies.
Its spikes were no protection.
It's burning brightly.
It's burning.
Used up and done for.
Black like my heart.
A tree will grow soon.
If trees could talk, they would scream at the sight of this.
It is cold and dead, like my heart.
A tiny life, ensconced in brittle death.
There is no thrum of life within this cold tree.
Can it never die?

Living LogLiving Log- 
It is forever silently screaming.
It's trying to grow up.
Maybe next time, sapling.
Consigned to the flames.
I like it dead, but I should plant this.
Plucked from the ground before their prime.
It's just a tuft of grass.
I have killed it.
It needs poop.
It smells funny.
I like to kill small things.
A snack perchance?
I shall have to wait.
It is barren.
It's just a bunch of reeds.
I have picked them.
Soon to be ashes.
I like to cut things up.
An edible plant.
Keep growing. I'll wait.
It is ready for harvest.
It's a plant.
A bush that always hurts.
Life is pain. Now it has no life.
Even thorns burn.
They are bright and cheery. Yuck.
I have destroyed something beautiful.
At least they're better than the other flowers.
They are painted with the colors of my soul.
It's a carrot that's in the ground.
Damp.
Dank.
Musty.
I would hide too, if I could.
Harvested.
This tree is spooky. I bet it likes Halloween.
Everything dies.
It's burning brightly.
Used up and done for.
A tree will grow soon.
The oppressive heat got to this one.
It just couldn't take the heat.
It succumbed to the heat.
It's had the life sucked out of it.
A tiny life, ensconced in brittle death.
Knives out.
Flattened.
Alone and rolling through life.
I can bend it to my will.
A jungle tree.
It's quite pretty.
I've won this round.
What lovely destruction.
Your sacrifice will not be in vain.
I should probably step back.
It's turned a beautiful shade of black.
I think it looks better like this.
Will you wither, or live?
Planting you again would be the true cruelty.
There's no going back, now.
It bears a tree if planted in the ground. Or burns if put in the fire.
Sticks... who cares...
Unruly life.
Damp.
That's one smart-looking plant.
A hearty weed.
It's quite elegant.
What a shame.
Its fruit bestows life, but only if I kill it.
I was expecting a darker secret.
I bet this leaf mourns its fallen tree.
This unassuming tree looks exactly how I feel.
What a pathetic sprout.
It claws at life.

This soil withered its soul.
I wish water brought me that much happiness.
Planting it would prolong its life.
Thorny and painful, like life.
Beauty surrounded by pain and suffering.
The jungle's noose.
Ancient, and full of life.
It flourishes on the waves of sorrow.

Lily PadLily Pad- 
How calm it looks upon the water.
Decorum is only a mask.
May I get lost within and never return.

Hedge (burning)- 

Hedge (burnt)- 

Intricate Topiary- 
It lends a false air of civility.
It longs for another life.
Weathered, like my soul.
I believe it is an imposter.
It has endured hardship.
More industrious than me.
Broken, like my soul.
Just a burning log.
Cold, dead and black, just like my heart.
Be ye alive or be ye dead?
I like it dead, but it should probably be returned to the earth.
It has been killed.
It never even knew it was alive. How fortunate.
The wait begins.
Its suffering will end soon.
How sad. You've no home.
They have already been torn away.
The blade has sentenced you to death.
Its joy was so disparaging...
This life appeared from nowhere.
It's unspeakably burnt.
How all must toil for the necessities of life.
Everything dies.
It's burning brightly.
Used up and done for.
Thin. Sad. Shriveled.
It looks so innocent.
It's sad it's not in the earth.
It is on the precipice...
It's not long for this world...
I could strip it clean, if I so chose...
It's given all it had to give.
There's no life to be had here...
How does it feel to be ripped from your home?
It has crumpled under the heat.
It cares nothing for the laws of this world...
Against all odds, it has flourished in life...
Prickly and blood red.
Life is resilient.
Plucked from the safety of its desert home.
It's just seaweed.
There's no more seaweed here.
It's like a very slimy whip.
The bleached remains of a dead tree.
It's met its end at our hands.
Oh. It's burning.
Your suffering is over now.
Bleached like bones left in the sun.
A fleeting beauty.
Delicate and impermanent.
It grows, against all odds.
It's born fruit.
It has nothing to offer me.
It will never again bear fruit.
I feel much the same.
Vileness spreads within it.
It is corrupt. Tainted.
Why do you persevere?
A wretched hive of scum and pollen.
They hide in their fortress of hate.
Pieces of beehive, scattered.
Home to the foulest creatures.
The remains of an evil beast.
A futile ward.
It's calling to me.
Even this obelisk has left me.
It's calling my name.
It's cold and black.
Maybe these statues will keep me company.
Even stone can not withstand the constant pull of decay.
Smooth and lifeless.
Time has broken it down.
No dignity at all.
Kill the pig. Spill his blood.
It cuts at the darkness.
Trying to break it would be pointless.
Even that is not permanent.
Some small rocks.
A tiny blade-like rock.
Herein lies the folly of man.
I will take it with me.
Some day, I will join you.
The earth has vomited up its secrets.
Oh look. More dirt.
Signs of the beast.
This trail leads nowhere.
I sense the beast's presence nearby.
No good can come of this.
Is it half built, or half destroyed?
It's still locked shut.
I am sure the next realm will be even more horrible!
It has no sharp edges.
It looks complicated.
It contains a vital spark.
What a hideous creation!
Life doesn't always make sense.
No matter what it consumes, it is never satisfied.
I emerge into this world once more.
Ophelia? Are you down there?
I envy his escape.
A nest of filth and villainy.
A tiny package full of death and destruction.
I'm too big to fall down there.
This home is not a happy one, I fear.
If they are not in there, where are they?
Oh, the stories this ship could tell.
Are you all alone?
I can't quite reach it.
Broken pieces of my heart.
A large piece of cold, unfeeling ice.
A large pool of cool, melted ice.
No trail, just a bunch of muck.
Down, down, down to the depths.
It's closed up. No one is falling down there, now.
Fire has broken it down even further.
Somehow, it found a way to sink even lower.
He's been burnt down.
I could curl up and die in there.
All cats must die.
What IS that?!
I killed it.
I was so, so close.
A poetic end.
A hole is just a grave that has yet to be covered.
How quaint.
Time has broken it down.
Fire has broken it down even further.
The meat swims round and round, oblivious.
A lobster dinner lives there.
The coral grows to escape the sea and finds...more nothing.
The sea gives them life, and yet they stretch to escape it.
What a foul worm.
Those look edible... sort of.
I picked it clean.
The earth's guts, cooled and ready for mining.
It's hot!
A very dapper item-storage system.
This looks impermanent.
I wonder if the sand knows of its own insignificance?
I smell... kitty litter?
A sizable sandpile.
A mountain that spews death to the heavens!
Hard to imagine this would birth forth such a horrific monster.
Looks like a fish with a gas problem.
Like Ishmael, my hunt is doomed.
I will find you, beast!
The behemoth reveals itself!
Corruption oozes from beneath.
Thick, with a stench of corruption.
A recipe for a slow painful death.
When I gaze into this limpid pool I dream I can see Abigail.
This pool burns with the volcano's anger!
They don't look that tough to me.
Ha!
Ah, this seems a sensible test of fate.
Dark energy courses through these mysterious portals...
That doesn't look like a reliable place to store things.
The ship has been obliterated.
It's just a box.
What lovely decor.
She sells seashells... oh, what's the point.
The ground belches death.
This is a safety hazard. Good.
Dead people's stuff.
It speaks to me.
I'm not above raiding a grave for loot.
Its crew is probably dead...
It's missing something.
It seems incomplete.
Looks a little screwy.
What possible use could this have?
This ring's probably not for wearing.
If only I could hide under a rock.
There's dreadfulness everywhere.
Grotesque.
It may comfort something but it doesn't comfort me.
Headed to death, like all of us.
It clutches at my heart.
An undead instrument of death.
A death stomper.
Iron. Like my heart.
Contains unreachable shiny things.
Death is not sparkly.
They're building their own doom.
I wish I could be happy with a pastoral existence.

Why would I want to prolong my life?

Of no use to me.
It's too heavy.

Rusted, like my soul.
An empty house. How apropos.
Even in purgatory it remains the most precious of metals.
I envy your escape.
Death has claimed it.
Its beauty is twinged with a heartbreaking sadness.
Dripping with enmity. And honey.
The bees left their sweet mark upon the earth.
It is not a danger... yet...
I feel.. Queasy...
A beautiful corruption lies at its base...
There's a sickly beauty to it...
Perhaps it wanted to hide the shame of its monstrous form?
The more the marble wastes, the more the statue grows.
We all have monsters within, I suppose.
It's been made whole again. Lucky.
Not everyone can be put back together after falling apart.
If only the rest of us could be whole again.
It wants out...
I could jump in and be done.
It's... a rock... Sigh.
The flame has cleansed this poor wretched soul.
Each of us wear many masks.
A chilling thought... What if nothing's beneath the mask?
Cold, hard stone...
Even that is not permanent.
It's traveled so far...
Its pallor reminds me of Abigail.
Cold and beautiful like death.
It's been ravaged by time.
I felt a terrible chill run down my spine.
Perhaps it thirsts for a sacrifice. Where's Webber...
Bathed in the pale eternal light...
That doesn't look right...
Now it will never decay...
Now it will never die...

Rock DenRock Den- 
Oh. The abyss is staring back at me...
I envy you, %s. Maybe I should play with %s?
My heart aches with its beauty.
A creature of shadow that seeks the light... how sad...
Strange marble debris...
Off with his head! Heehee.
How did this get here?
I can make that face too...
A 'puppy', frozen in time.
Should we peek inside...?
A place to drown my sorrows.

Cave-in BoulderCave-in Boulder- 
Call me Sisyphus.
So close, yet so far away.
It's a starfish.
If only it had swallowed me whole.
A pity it didn't crunch me up when it had the chance.
Heehee. Yes, I'd love to hear a secret.
It doesn't feel good to be incomplete.
It wants to find its missing pieces.
Abby and I will help put you back together.
It wants some sort of energy.
I see the light.
Even the earth is falling apart under the pressure.
When I gaze upon my reflection, a ghost stares back at me.
I don't see how this helped.
The top is solid glass.
Nothing left for me here...
I sense a presence within...
What a sickly color.
Its sharp edge would end this quickly.
The sea rejects its dead.
I could steer toward it and resign myself to a watery fate.
Terrible creatures lurk within.

Someone is trying to keep the underground at bay.
I'm too busy descending into madness to descend that cave.
A great evil lurks beneath the surface.
Why leave? The light here compliments my complexion.
The surface beckons.
It looks like a rotting hat.

These are some strange trees.
It looks fragile.

They're just lurking in there...
All its efforts fall on rocky soil.
It has a glowing presence.
It's trying so hard. Why?
This one is frail and scorned. Like a friend.
Its life is short, but beautiful.
It has no concept of time, or loss.
Be free, little one!
So many have perished. But this one is safe.
This is the fate of all things.
It seems out of place.
It is death, preserved.
We must find more pieces.
Death has a sense of humor.
What horrors have we resurrected here today?
These bones are grimly misassembled...
It has no will to live.
Someone is trying to keep the underground at bay.

Not very attractive.
I hear the painful echoes of the dead.
It is full of the echoes of the dead.

Cold, dead artificial life.
A leftover of an ancient world.

Fragments of a powerful material.
How does it manage to grow like that?
Life is a gamble.
My, what magnificent horns you have!
It pulls power from beneath.
It is touched by death.
It judges my very being.
We failed... again...
It accepted our items.
A beacon of hope left unlit... How fitting.
Take us far from here.
Hope springs infernal.
Oh well. I hope it's a quick death.
We can't do that again for awhile.
Scrawlings of a tongue lost to time.
There is no light to be found.
A deathly light dances across the room.
A people struck by famine and sorrow.
A piece of their story, lost to time.
They are consumed by darkness.
Then, rebirth.
Finally, a city, full of life.
A tortured soul.
Ah, this is where fiery items are forged.
A beany gift from the heavens.
All wounds heal in time, little bush.
It could use a pick me up.
I feel the same way, friend.
Shall I put you back in the ground and grant you life?
This plant doesn't want anyone to touch it.
It's sad and painful.
It's hiding below.
Do I have to carry it?

Do you burn to the touch?
Stone forged of fire.
I can't tell what you used to be.
A wretched shadow of its former self.

There are mysteries hidden within there.
Alas, too good for the likes me.
Under lock and key.
For when I feel I can go no further.
Wreckage is all that remains.
I always knew the ocean floor would be my final resting place.
If we sailed forever we would never reach the horizon.
That would be too easy.
Yet still I am directionless.
It's just ground.
Some ground.
Some ground.
It's just ground.
A gnarled and twisted surface.
It's just ground.
Some ground.
Some road.
Some ground.
Some ground.
A cold, soulless horse.
What does he pray for?
A Rook? Or is it a Castle?
Another battle lost to time.
Time has won this battle.
Time erodes everything.
Demon! Show yourself!
I am attacked!

Evil is sleeping.
I must beware.
We will meet again some day.
Alas, brave warrior.
Even in death, this beast causes pain.
So slippery and fine.

It smells of goat.
Horrid swamp thing!
He's little and warty.
He's asleep.
Life is small and short.
Long and thin and dangerous!
Sharp, slimy and dangerous.
These are better left unmentioned.
So this is what goes on down below.
This one is different.
It shall return, some day.
Babies!
This little piggie looks mean.
A creature of the night!
He has risen from the grave!
An old man, of the sea.
The cycle of violence continues.
I shall gnash thee.
What feverish thoughts transpired beneath this?
Takes life so it may live.
I can feel its stolen warmth.
A sack of blood ripped from a mosquito. I love it.
Mosquitoes! Let my veins be a feast!
A cowardly spider.
It's chewing on something.
A creature of the night.
It consumes all.
Life goes on.
They follow their master's every wish.
Ah, to be so simple.
An empty bag of hunger.
The darkness has drained the color from their fur.
It comes from the depths.
It seems out of place.
Is something there?
I should put it out of its misery.
This offers no hope of warmth.
A true bastion of evil.
Extra-spooky!

BirchnutterBirchnutter- 
Balls of battle!
If I stuck my head in its jaws, that would be the end.
Pierce me with your venomous fangs...
A damp death awaits me...
That thing has anger issues!
That's too many eyes!
Now when I shoot someone a look it'll pack a punch!
A future friend of Abigail's?
As if bloodsucking wasn't low enough, this one leaves you sick.
What a lovely shade of puke-yellow.
Devoid of arms or legs. I'd be angry too.
The only thing worse than a snake is a poisoned snake.
The snake won't be needing this anymore.
A warrior of the night!
I must beware.
Alas, brave warrior.
Terror of the sea!
They fly to escape their own hideousness.
This fish cuts death with its face!
There is the hate of life in its burning eyes!
It is very big. And very dead.
It would make a lovely pet, if not for the whole... murder thing.

Consume me and be done with it.
Why can't you just leave me be?
At least it will be a quick end.

Take my heart's blood, I've no use for it.
I wish you nightmares.
Now you may kill no more.
It doesn't matter if it's pig or bat skin.
Snakes are everywhere.
Its sole existence is to annoy me.
Bits of bug carcass.
Time wins all battles.
How Orwellian.
I gnash at thee.
It thieves others' life to maintain its own.
Some chains are physical...
Their devotion knows no bounds.
It burns with the fires of Hell.
It's dead.
Fare thee well.
You should have stayed dead.
For this creature, to live is to suffer.
Don't wake up.
It's better this way.
To let it live would be a cruelty.
Don't wake up.
It's better this way.
Death on legs.
It slumbers soundly.
It's the way of all things.
What demented thoughts must lie behind those eyes.
He follows me unto his doom.
To sleep, perchance to dream.
His nakedness is now on display.
I wonder if it misses its old family?
More of the world is within the beast than without.
Together we can venture far.
The world has wronged you.
Somewhere, a beefalo is naked and cold.
It sounds like there's a beefalo trapped inside.
Enjoy your youth. Soon you will learn the terrors of this world.
Don't wake up.

BeeBee- 
I'd steer clear of that stinger.
A bee with a cold, dead heart.
Be still, little one.
Sharp and deadly.
They are so standoffish.
I still feel alone.
He is better off, now.
The hide of a pig that once was.
What tormented inner lives they must have.
It contains his fuzzy wuzzy essence.
A beast of solitude.
It stands against the cruel elements.
All dressed up, but where to go?
What terrible sights they have seen.
It is mindlessly chasing after rocks.
That one has a larger shell.
It shimmers with slimy anticipation.
Pieces of broken slurtle dreams.
I doubt it will help me more than it did for the original owner.
Now I can hide from my problems.
Living without the burden of intelligence must be nice.
I hear they feed on the dead.
I wonder if it had a twin, too.
It's matted, patchy and putrid.
Look at those hooves.
Chaaaarge!
A weird curling horn.
It looks sad.
Something this big and dead will surely stink.
A chipper little fellow. I wonder if he knows life is pointless.
Remnants of destruction.
The sting isn't deadly. Only painful.
How can such a curious thing even live?
You are heavy with meat. Let me lighten your load.
It's been severed from its owner.
His joviality is almost endearing. Almost.
What's it got to be so angry about?
Another abomination.
Even you cannot cheer my heart.
It's been severed from an animal head.
A creature of dirt and purpose.
Perchance to dream...
Gone to a better place.
A horror.
It's been separated from its animal.
Even you cannot escape death.
Nothing guards against encroaching darkness.
A bee without conscience.
It certainly didn't help the original owner.
A suit to hide from one's problems.
It prefers to be alone.
You simply look too delicious.
It is arrested by deepest sleep.
Pretty, but short-lived.
I hold its life in my hands.
Take thy beak from out my heart!
He is mine.
Does that mean spring is coming? I hope not.
He likes being trapped in my pocket.
Life in the barren, frozen wastes.
It's so soft. It is my enemy.
A crow feather, black like eternal darkness.
A redbird feather, red like blood.
A snowbird feather, white like the light at the end of the tunnel.
Dumb bird! Stay away from my berries!
It's looking into my soul.
Not so much sleeping as... waiting.
The eyebone was incinerated in the teleportation!
A fuzzy ball of emptiness.
He's wandering mindlessly, oblivious to his fate.
He is safely in my embrace.
A tiny brightness in the dark.
Tiny lights, stranded from the world outside my pocket.
The mighty mandrake. I should pick it at night.
Onward, my vegetable minions!
Alas, poor mandrake!
It was a good death. He will be delicious.
Oh my, that hurt! Yet, again I wake to life.
Well aren't you a happy little fuzzball. Die.
Flower of the night.
Even flowers of the night die.
The flower was incinerated in the teleportation!
Even his wings are small and cheery.
Fuzzball excrement.
Stay down there, away from this horrible place.
You should go back to where it's dark.
How do you like being torn away from your family?
Life takes such curious forms! Yet death claims them all.
This island has a crustacean infestation.
You can't hide from your problems forever. I've tried.
Such graceful swimming. Such tasty flesh.
I could see myself growing old with a houseful of these.
A dead fish thingy. Looks important.
All that's left after another beautiful fire.
I would not trust him with a fish, but perhaps my junk...
It seems so content.
This jellyfish is much more vibrant than the others.
Is it my ears, or does the creature chatter a lonesome monologue?
If I whispered my secrets to it, would it keep them safe?
The scavengers of land and sea.
As if it weren't bad enough they foul the air.
It sings a tortured song.
She is surely an ill omen.
This bird seems too stupid to be alive.
With every one of these the island gets dumber. And meatier.
A spot of color in a dreary world.
What a dumb egg.
This is probably a mercy.
Not extinct yet, though not from lack of trying.
How cute. And dumb.

WobsterWobster- 
This thing would taste very good dead and covered in butter.
I commend this creature's commitment to cannibalism.
Earthly wealth has no use in death.

KingfisherKingfisher (normal and held)- 
Thy sharp beak might impale me from the depths of the sea.
It slumbers, for now.
Death knows no mercy.
A parrot as blue as me.
To squawk, to croon, no more.
A wretched creature.
What horrors does it dream of?
I don't blame you.
A symbol of the ugliness of this world.
Alas, she has fallen from her grotesque perch.
Even the hideous sleep sounder than I.
How I envy you.
A small light in a dark world.
A fool and his gold.
Many eyes witness many horrors in life.

Peagawk SleepingPeagawk Hidden SleepingPeagawk (sleeping)- 

Peagawk DeadPeagawk (dead)- 

Peagawk PlumePeagawk Plume- 
I spy, with my little eye...
Too naive to know pain.
Such a innocent sleep.
Even the innocent must die.
You exist to amuse others.
It could strike me down.
Nothing shocks me anymore.
Dumb bird! Stay away from the berries!
The mighty mandrake. It's best picked at night.
Onward, vegetable minion!
Now it's just food.
It was a good death. You will be delicious.
Yet, again I wake to life. Sigh.
This is a creature ruled by fear.
It's not floating, yet.
It's reached its natural state.
He is blissfully ignorant.
Such a cherry yellow... I can't stand it.
You're at my mercy, bird.
Pestilence and death will soon claim you.
A canary feather, golden as the gilded cage.
A spark of life illuminating the darkness.
Enjoy your happiness while it lasts, little lavae.
He is suffering the pangs of hunger.
He is approaching death.
Is it even worth it to put stake in your future?
The egg is warm, but my heart is still cold.
This egg is almost as cold as my heart.
Forsooth, it's a tooth.
Cold-blooded.
It lives in a constant state of fear.
That horn won't protect you.
We have grabbed life by its horn... though I wish we hadn't.
Oh, to be so carefree.
Life is not fair, is it?
It slumbers soundly.
I despise how it skitters...
Freedom is not for you.
It is arrested by deepest sleep.
It is no more.
Such beauty can never last.
Give up. You won't escape my grasp.
Free from the shackles of the sky.
That egg represents a new life. Ugh.
The nest is empty. Vacant. Barren. A void.
So full of potential.
All that promise, snatched away. Not bad with bacon.
A tiny fragile being, struggling towards the light.
I spared it the torment of living.
It cannot bear the heat.
Chilled by the darkness.
A life sooner begun is a life sooner ended.
Soon now.
Hello there, little one.
Are you empty inside?
A black hole from which seeds never return.
Will you leave me too?
We all try to fill the void.
Your true nature is revealed!
You try my patience.
A tiny, fragile being, struggling for the light.
Will you leave too?
A lumbering beast.

Spider QueenSpider Queen- 
She is regal in her horribleness.
Time to stare into the abyss.
Death incarnate!
What terrors it must see.
He must be lonely. Trapped in such a small cage.
All that remains of a once great beast.
It could crush me in one blow. I wish it would.
It smells like death.
It's an abomination.
Not sure how a thing like that happens.
A new life. The last thing anyone needs.
Plucked like Abigail was from me.
It's burning on the inside.
Scales of pain.
It spit up.
It's cooled off and smells funny.
Oh... no...
Kneel to me, foul beast!
Oh gee, I'm Quacken' in my boots.
What wonders lie within?
Its gnashing days are over.
Nature is very angry!

SealSealnado (seal form)- 
It has no awareness of the ills of this world.
No longer turning.
It pulses with unknown power.
Orange striped death on water!
Tyger, tyger, burning bright...
No one's breathing through these now.
You'll die just like everything else.
A reminder of my own mortality.
Life is fragile. Even for evil snakes.
Brings me no joy.
The empty life of an aristocrat has made her irate.
Heavy hangs the crown.
The end is nigh.
Remnant of a doomsayer.
Like Abigail, it has been resurrected from a deep sleep.
Nothing surprises me anymore.
It was summoned by the death of its family...
A cradle of life. I hate it.
As regal as she is ruthless...
What dark machinations were once concocted beneath?
I see him when I'm sleeping...
The beast returns unchained.
The key to our prosperity...
Look how whimsical it is... We must kill it.
Just like the one in my heart.
Something has filled the void. In the ground, I mean.
Just swallow us whole and end our misery.
I think I'll be reunited with Abigail soon.
A death cap, surely.
Death in mushroom form.
A reminder of the death we wrought.
Not even death is permanent.
I am caged!
It has spirits to protect it...
Death would be a kindness.
I shall wrap myself in death's sweet embrace.
A tortured mind dwelled within.
An ember that burns with the stuff of nightmares.
A blessing in disguise.
I feel a strange kinship with him.
Live it up while you can, Your Majesty.
Trapped by Maxwell's statues, forever alive.
That's my twin sister, Abigail.
Harbinger of doom.
His finery does nothing to mask the smell.
I envy his contentment.
He's disappearing. Like hope.
Destruction inside doom inside catastophe.

Don't Starve Together
Wendy PortraitInspecting self- 
When I look in the mirror, it's like Abigail's here.
Do you know any riddles?
The gifts made it happier...
A deep rage brews within...
It came from the belly of the sphinx.
Take me far from here.
Aim for my heart...
Mockery of a spoiled childhood.
My warped reflection stares back at me with malice.
A moment frozen in time.
I can feel their fear and loneliness.
How do you do, %s?
%s is unstable.
You've gone mad, scientist.
Abigail likes you, %s.
That was a bad experiment, %s...
Douse your fires, %s.
How do you do, %s?
%s is a madwoman.
You've made a terrible error, %s.
Abigail likes you, %s. Do you like her?
Say hi to Abigail while I go get you a heart, %s.
Let's watch the world burn together, %s.
Hi %s. Why are you shaking?
I don't trust %s. Fear makes people dangerous.
Strength is meaningless if you can't catch me...
Don't be scared, %s. Abigail just wants to be friends.
%s... Everyone leaves...
Fire won't protect you, %s.
She looks sad...
%s... she's no sister of mine.
Have we not seen enough death, %s?
I hope Abigail doesn't like you more than me...
At least a heart could return one sister to this world...
Fire probably isn't the method I would choose...
How do you do, %s?
Do you have a conscience, %s?
None of us are above death, %s!
Abigail likes you, %s.
Say 'Pretty Please' and I might get you a heart, %s.
I'd begun to think you were all talk, %s.
How do you do, Ms. %s?
Ms. %s... do you turn your wits against us?
'Murder', she wrote.
Abigail likes you, Ms. %s.
Everyone that leaves takes a piece of my heart...
Ms. %s, wreathed in flames.
How do you do, %s?
%s is plotting something dastardly with that axe.
I'll send you someplace much nicer than this, %s.
Abigail likes you, %s. But she likes Lucy more.
We'll get a heart, but are you sure you want to come back, %s?
He pinky-promised I'd get to ride on his shoulders. Such lies.
The curse haunts you even in death, %s?
It looks like your condition has worsened, %s.
I'll find a way to return you to this mortal coil. If you wish.
Hah... you look so silly I almost... well, nevermind.
Why stay when you could fly away from this place?
Fire setting does not seem in your best interest...
How do you do, %s?
There's something you're not telling us...
%s, this is the end... for you!
Abigail says she understands you, %s.
You won't leave us if I get you a heart, right?
There are other ways to express yourself, %s.
How are you coping, %s?
I don't think I trust %s yet.
Cursed villain!
He's gone from Sisyphus to Lazarus.
Should I revive you, %s? Hmm...
Are you trying to kindle a bad reputation?
How do you do, %s?
%s... she's bloodthirsty.
It'll all be over soon, %s.
It seems your heart is strong too, %s...
Come back, %s... Take my heart...
Do the Norse have a god of fire, %s?
Hey, %s!
%s, are you friend... or foe?
Don't worry, %s. This won't hurt a bit.
You could never be a monster, %s.
A heart could bring back my friend, %s...
%s, let's find a game that doesn't involve... burning.
How do you do, %s?
There is anger in %s's heart.
Hi %s. Abigail says 'thank-you'.
You can't escape that way, %s. I've tried.
Is fire important in your line of work...?
Heehee. You're funny, %s.
You haven't been a good imp today, %s.
Abby and I will put your souls to rest!
%s is reliable when it counts.
Did you lose a game, %s?
Abby and I know what you did, %s.
How do you do, %s?
%s has developed a taste for blood.
Don't worry, %s. I'll end it quickly.
%s's friendship extends beyond the veil.
You were too good for this world, %s.
If you play with fire, you're liable to get burned...
How do you do, %s?
What if he was just fattening us up, all along?
Your treachery ends here, %s.
Sometimes he shows he cares without cooking.
I'll mourn you, %s.
Abby and I know what you've been doing.
Hello, %s.
If you won't play nice, you can't play with us!
You should've stayed hidden in your swamp!
That was very nice of you, %s.
I'm so sorry, %s.
Maybe we should play a different game...
How do you do, %s?
%s... they'll betray us.
Murderer! Cutthroat!
Abigail likes you, %s.
A heart could return %s to this world...
Do you wish to see the world burn?
So much hope, dashed.
No bird will ever come of it.
It is still bloody.
The blood has been cooked away.
Meat turned dry and delicious.
It smells like tiny fear.
Fire has purified it.
Evilness pervades it.
Cooked evil is still evil.
Meat turned dry and weird-tasting.
It has a foul smell.
It's only slightly more appealing.
Makes a good thud and it has nutrients!
Less raw, more tasty.
It was flopping around desperately for life. The poor fool.
A proper grilling puts a stop to the flopping.
An eel.
An eel that has been cooked.
I would have preferred the ears.
Separated from its only friend.
It looks even worse now.
Torn right from the frog.
Definitely not twitching any longer.
If only I could fly away.
They once held such great potential.
It has shed its earthly tether.
Its sword face couldn't save it...
It's offensively bright.
It was a painless death. The beast had no nervous system.
It's sort of like gelatin.
Death has come for it.
Beautiful, even in death.
So... tough.
It's been decapitated.
This is just plain false advertisement.
A proper griling puts a stop to the flopping.
There are other fish in the sea. Bigger ones, hopefully.
It will... tide... me over for now.
They eat of the rock, I eat of them.
Depressing.
You cannot hide beneath the waves, meat!
I sure strong-armed this mussel.
The beginnings of life...
I spared them the pain of hatching.
It misses its watery home.
I've... eaten worse...
The stripes symbolize its emotional imprisonment.
Don't lose your head.
A pitiful creature.
Rest now, fish spirit.
It won't be needing this anymore.
You should cook up nicely.
It's a feast!
That's grotesque.
This heart's as dead as my own, although much warmer.
These poisonous legs will hasten my demise.
One can only hope the poison has not left.
Eww.
It tastes how it looks.
Makes a good thud, and it's nutritious!
It didn't have enough time to grow.
I'm afraid you've splished your last splash.
I suppose it will do for now.
All my efforts reap only the smallest rewards.
It looks oddly... crunchy?
What a horrendous looking creature.
I'm afraid your time is up.
It fought hard to live. A shame, really.
My luck couldn't possibly be worse than it already is.
Its existence must be so confusing.
These berries are tart.
More balanced flavor, but they won't last long.
The peels look dangerous.
Warmed banana mush is so much better.
This isn't shaped like a dragon at all.
Still not a dragon. At least it's dead.
Spiky and smelly!
Less spiky, but even smellier!
So many juicy red bits to chomp and squish!
Warm, but no less messy.
It's mostly water. What's the big deal?
Now it's warm water.
The peels look dangerous.
Warmed banana mush is so much better.
Such armor. What does this fruit have to hide?
Two halves that were once whole. Where are you now, Abigail?
It's a little sweet.
These look stimulating.
Who knew the will to live came in bean form?
I'd better consume these before death does.
This hasn't halted the decay, merely stalled it.
It's a carrot.
It's a carrot that's gone through a gauntlet of fire.
I could make a corny joke, but I'll refrain.
This corn couldn't handle the heat.
Almost a deadly nightshade. Almost.
Cooking this nightshade made it even less deadly.
It's as big as the hole where my heart was.
It shriveled a tiny bit from the heat. I like that.
A mushroom after my own heart.
This mushroom is disappointingly normal.
A fungus to preserve the monotony.
All is malleable.
There's a slight humming coming from it.
Fleeting, just like life.
It's still dangerous.
I ripped all its spikes off.
Even the knife-plant has a flower. Ugh.
Even the sea suffers weeds.
Better, but it's still a weed.
It keeps longer like this. Tastes better too.
That looks like lunch.
Sweet. Just like me.
Were that my despair tasted half so sweet.
It dies so that others may live.
Cooked cactus.
Vegetables are good for you, but what do I care?
I could eat it. If I felt like eating anything.
Your life is as insignificant as mine.
Best case scenerio: it kills me.
This beauty will also die.

NettleNettle- 
I suppose these will cure blocked sinuses.
The color of my blood.
It can't taste any worse when it's cooked.
Will I be dead before it ripens?
Perhaps I'm lucky and it's still poisoned.
Pretty flower.
Should I eat the flower too?
It's as big as the hole where my heart once was.
Its defenses have been stripped away.
If I ever feel like eating anything, I'll eat it.
Better the worm's light than its tongue.
It's... I don't know. Sigh.
The things we do for sustenance.
We took it out of the ocean, then took the ocean out of it.
It grew on a tree, but it looks like a rock.
I can eat it now.
It might actually taste good at this point.
It gives food flavor.
It smells a bit nice.
I never cry.
It will never make anyone cry again.
It looks so tiny and insignificant.
What can this tiny plant possibly do to fill my empty life?
It has eyes, yet it never cries.
Now its eyes will never open.
Red as heart's blood.
Its flesh is far more bloody now.
A balanced breakfast to start another miserable day.
Let's see you get out of this sugary trap!
Well, at least it's a pie now.
Perfectly molded blocks of fish.
I hope I got all the bones out.
The perfect amount of jam.
I never thought frog's legs could look so good.
Sweet, tart and in a cup.
A sweet sauce for this creature's sweet embrace.
Meat cut into tiny pieces. Just like my heart.
Meat, skewered right through the center.
Boiled the life out of him.
Balled meat. How exciting.
They died. And then I put them in a stew.
Cooked evil is still evil, even in lasagna.
A lovely little pouch of nutrients.
I would have to be desperate.
A... cookie...
A whole bunch of cooked vegetables. Riveting.
A nightshade. Probably not filled with poison.
Never imagined I could make a thing so sweet.
Who's gobbling now?
It looks more appetizing this way.
They're definitely waffles.
A miserable mess, just like life.
Ugh, more flowers.
That's just gruesome. I like it.
Ice cream could never replace Abigail.
The melon is in stasis.
Burn my insides.
A handful of sustenance.
I used to eat these with Abigail...
Feed the body, starve the soul...
Crabbit, dressed up in a seaweed jacket.
All I taste is my sadness...
Bitter...
Death comes to us all. Sometimes on a stick.
I would like a spoon.
Its death will give me life.
A sea once teeming with life. No more.
It's tasted a mortal escape. I'll be tasting it.
It could be worse.
Could I get this a la mode?
Looks good, tastes horrible.
My mouth's watering just looking at it.
Delicate, but delicious.
I took their life to sustain my own.
A brief respite from the hunger.
Soup.
Something died for this.
It fills me with no joy.
It's hard crust reminds me of life.
Refreshing, but it still does not relieve my grief.
Temporary relief for life's grief.
A broth made from a dead animal.
Doesn't spice up my life.
Old family recipe.
Abigail loved tea parties.
Hopefully no bones still linger.
You'd be surprised how much life can be gleaned from death and bones.
Why indulge in such childish things?
Who knew such sweet things could exist here?
Abigail hated spicy foods.
Beans that shall never know life.
Supper looks good.
I missed having someone make me dinner...
It's actually... really good...
Cold and watery like a sailor's grave.
It swirls like the endless abyss.
My stomach rumbles just looking at it...
Thank-you, Warly.
It tastes like melancholy. Mmm.
They're so good I almost forgot my crushing grief.
A dish as delicate as life itself.
Spiralling, just like my life.
I don't feel much like dancing.
It zaps your tongue.
Life, or at least the promise of it.
One day, this seed will be a carrot.
Yup, it's a seed.
It's a seed. It won't grow a dragon.
Miraculously, the seeds don't smell.
It's a nightshade seed.
I was expecting more seeds than this from that thing.
It's a seed. Exciting.
I toasted their life away.
A sweet, but fleeting treat.
No more can the butterfly soar.
I wasn't expecting that.
Everything turns to waste, eventually.
The way of all things.
The wretched beast must have been sick.
Roasted dead.
I think it's curdled.
Perfectly shaped for spitting.
The perfect meal for a blubbering fool.
Is that what I look like inside?
Perhaps these could give new life.
Traces of toil.

Flytrap StalkFlytrap Stalk- 
In death the plant serves me.

A drop of life in this bleak existence.

Carrot SeedsCarrot Seeds- 
It's a carrot that's waiting to be.
The seed of life, so tiny in my hand.
The fire has toasted their life away.
We stole it out of the mouths of baby bees.
The life they contain is a mystery.
The life they contain is a mystery.
Will I live to see this grow?
The life they contain is a mystery.
The life they contain is a mystery.
It's still so pretty.
It was my sister's flower. She's gone far away.
I can sense Abigail's presence growing stronger.
Abigail is almost here!
Abigail is ready to play, but she needs some space.
I need to show Abigail how to play.
Whoever drew this is probably dead.
The insides of a mechanical demon.
All that's left after another beautiful fire.
This was once some thing before it got burned...
Red like my heart's blood.
Blue like... er... a sad bird?
It reminds me of my mother.
The flaws are its most beautiful features.
Such things used to bring me happiness.
That's just nasty.
Life is blood and this.
The inevitable byproduct of life.
Perfectly misshapen.
It's a fake. Just a temptation, like death.
If only knives solved more of my problems...
I'd carry this to the end of the world.
I'd fly this straight into the sun, if only it was bigger.
Once alive with electricity, they've met their end.
Just a simple game.
I wish I could take a bath.
Mismatched buttons for a mismatched life.
Another mouth to feed.
Lucky robot, it never had a soul.
Not so slimy any more, are we?
I can almost make out a tiny solar system.
Childhood memories.
He's better this way.
Choking hazard.
Whoever drew this is probably six feet under.
Their dead drop the cure to their sickness.
The currency of scallywags.
Frozen like my heart.
The last desperate act of a doomed soul. In a bottle.
Farewell, chum.
This fills me with a sense of mistrust.
It brings naught but death.
The peoples that forged this are long dead.

I do love a cup of coffee and a good book.
Takes me back to my youth. Sort of.
I'd almost forgotten what real food tasted like.
How decadent.
I can feel the heartburn already!
I may have meddled with a delicate ecosystem to make this.
The perfect dish.
Sticky fingers will ensue.
Monster meat, dressed up fancy.
Clam soup.
Quite delicious.
Differentiated from roe chiefly by the jar.
An inventive twist on a traditional Marseille dish.
Smelly, but quite nutritious.
An entomophagic feast!
Rather gummy.
I'm quite certain these aren't normal taco shells.
Invigorating.
Medicinal nourishment.
A hearty broth.
It's quite piquant.
I am prepared for an unforgettable luncheon.
Give me tea and a good book.
Blue eggs and bacon!
Personally I relish a spot of spice on my fish.
It was an interesting choice to serve it as a sandwich.
Honey was the only sweetener used for this lovely ham.
Meat on a stick, what next?
Not quite how mum used to make, but it smells superb!
Lasagna or no, it would be hazardous to consume it.
This aubergine has been cooked and packed with comestibles.
That's terrible for your teeth, dear.
Sweets, emulsified with beeswax.
Extremely savory. I wouldn't mind seconds.
I do like fresh greens.
I'll happily volunteer to taste-test.
Ah! A classic Spanish cuisine.
A brand new recipe I see. Marvelous!
I wouldn't mind a bite or two, myself.
He's so very talented.
It tastes a bit like magic.
Just a tad spicy for me!
It looks lovely, dear.
How creative!
My goodness, that has some zest to it!
His ingenuity with limited materials is very impressive.
A handful of unidentifiable seeds.

Seed of aubergine.
Seeds of Punica granatum, separated from their arils.

A toasted embryonic plant treat!
Sweetened plant nectar.
Wings from a captured butterfly.
Lepidopterous lipids?
It is heavy with bacteria.
How unappetizing.
The congealed mucus retains its sticky texture.
I've cooked the poison out of them.
Tantalizing!
Plant to grow a lanatus.
A buoyant and lipid-rich substance.
Ingenious!
To grow another root vegetable.
Surplus clippings to be used in bartering.

Flytrap StalkFlytrap Stalk- 
Salvaged from that terrible creature.

Magic WaterMagic Water- 
It appears seed-like.

Asparagus SeedsAsparagus Seeds- 

Radish SeedsRadish Seeds- 

Tuber SeedsTuber Seeds- 

Don't Starve Together
Roasted BirchnutRoasted Birchnut- 
The poison has been successfully cooked out of them.
Ah. This will grow some fresh vegetables.
In the wild this might have produced more queens.
Mutated seed of Allium cepa.
Mutated seed of Allium sativum.
A Capsicum seed.
Mutated seed of Solanum tuberosum.
Mutated seed of Solanum lycopersicum.
A detailed technical drawing.
Various cogs and wheels.
Some non-aqueous residue remaining after the fire.
This used to be something, but now it's just a pile of ash.
It is warm.
It is cold.
Perhaps it is similar to Citrine.
Chromium impurities have colored this gem green.
It looks like a Spessartite garnet.
This is human facial hair.
A quantity of animal feces. How fragrant.
More metabolic byproduct.
What a lovely set of bottle washers! Too bad they're all melted.
A fake membranophone.
Oh, I just love the bard.
What a positively, delightfully odd little fellow.
This spacecraft looks to have inadequate thermal controls.
A tangled mess of wires, not much good for anything.
I'd rather use my hands to read a book.
It reminds me of my bath tub. I could use a long soak.
Hmm, don't think I'm missing any buttons at the moment.
Don't need these yet: I've still got a few teeth left.
Ah, it's a scale replica of that mischievous robot.
A muscular hydrostat that's been sat near something hygroscopic.
Perhaps a larger staff would summon a larger star.
That is a most unusual skull.
Remnants of a life well lived.
We must take the proper steps when using this knowledge.
It's not as nice as Lucy.
It's almost as nice as Lucy.
Dig a hole. Plant a tree!
Time to dig golden holes.
Almost an axe, but not quite.
It's pretty, but can't chop down trees.
A true lumberjack never shaves.
Everyone makes mistakes, eh?
This really isn't my style.
My mouth's dry just looking at it.
Ooh, that's a thing for choppin'.
It chops AND sparkles!
Don't get jealous, Lucy.
That really isn't my style.
The bird murder wasn't even necessary. Heh.
You could debark a log with this thing.
Yep, that'll get us there.
Makes me feel like a Mountie.
Makes me feel like some sorta woodland nymph, eh?
Puts the critter back to how nature intended.
I'm gonna reel in a whopper, no doubt aboot it.
Where's my guitar?
It uses wood.
Uh oh! It's bit high!
I'm using too much wood too fast!
I love a fire in the evening.
Mmmm. Smells woody.
I should probably do something aboot that, eh?
There should be some wood around here somewhere.
It's almost gone.
I should go chop some wood for that, eh?
It was good while it lasted.
If only I had some wood.
Trees by torchlight.
Down deep in a coal mine.
It better not tip over.
High tech!
Where's my electric guitar?
It uses wood.
Uh oh! It's bit high!
I'm using too much wood too fast!
I love a cold fire in the evening.
Mmmm. Smells woody.
I should probably do something aboot that, eh?
There should be some wood around here somewhere.
It's almost gone.
I should go chop some wood for that, eh?
It was good while it lasted.
If only I had some wood.
Now featuring night-time chopping!
It's like armor for fire.
You okay in there, glowin' buddies?
I can go night fishing, eh?
It's a boat light.
Looks like the perfect place to light a fire.
I'm using too much wood too fast!
Mmmm. Smells woody.
There should be some wood around here somewhere.
I should go chop some wood for that, eh?
If only I had some wood.
Simple little light, that.
Lil water never stopped a woodsman.
Burning like mad!
Steady going.
Gettin' a touch low.
It's aboot to go right out.
Needs a good log.
Now I can chop trees in the dark.
It's a little batty.
Too much wood, too fast!
This'll make it feel more like home.
That's too much wood too fast!
My kind of décor.
Soak in that all-natural light, Lucy.
Whose bright idea was it to kill the lights?
It oughta be green like a lush, choppable, forest.
It illuminates with all the colors of the wind.
That got charred real good.
Keep it away from the trees!
That's my rucksack.
I used all parts of the pig.
I'll show those birds yet!
It can collect skeeters.
I should spend some time at the lake.
I've slept on worse back at the lumber camp.
I love camping.
I'm used to sleeping in worse.
Work smarter, eh?
At least I didn't have to pay for it.
Healthiness in goo form.
This will keep my beard dry, eh?
True North.
South.
East.
West.
Northeast.
Southeast.
Northwest.
Southwest.
Points to True North.
The paper's brown. Like wood.
I need some things to wrap first, eh?
What's inside? Hope it's logs.
Good for long hikes.
A traditional Canadian fan.
Naps are important during a long day of chopping.
I prefer to siesta between chopping sessions, not at night.
My belly is rumbling. I'd never be able to relax.
Can't siesta, something chasing me.

Tent BurntTent (burnt)- 
I don't think it can still be considered a tent.
It's a husk.
We call those 'night rocks' back home.
Brrr! It's frozen.
It's gone cold, eh?
It's getting a bit... medium.
I could chop all winter with that in my pocket!
This will keep my beard moderately dry, eh?
Now I can carry more delicious wood.
A bag for my booty.
It's for holding my treasures.
I'm not used to the heat in this place!
What're you smiling at?
I think I did a pretty good job on this 'breller.
Tastes awful, but it works!
The best shelter a woodcutter could ask for.
Huh. Better than a flyswatter, I guess.
Ugh. Those birds don't deserve this.
That's a decent looking rucksack.
Used all the parts of the pig.
Something like that'd keep my beard dry, eh?
It's getting a bit... tepid.
That there could keep my beard moderately dry, eh?
I need to share this with somebody!
This should cure those sniffles.
Could be fun times lobbin' these around.
I'm not used to the heat in this place!
Just needs a light.
Cute, ain't he Luce?
It's all scorched.
I guess I should be used to weird stuff by now.
Hm. Yep. Just another day.
Poor lil' guy.
A handy knapsack for conserving food!
It seems a waste to just leave it sitting there empty.
It'll be a bit longer, eh?
Oh boy! Here it comes!
Time for supper!
Not the greatest idea, eh?
Bees!
I get hungry just looking at it.
I could get more if I waited.
Honey!
I prefer larger plants.
They'll never reach chopping size.
Time for grub.
I think it needs some poop.
Ahhhh. Reminds me of home.
It's set up... just add meat.
This is like watching meat dry.
That looks done.
Burned to a crisp.
No, not the bees!
If it was a tree farm, I'd be sad.
This is like watching meat dry in rain.
Its usefulness has dried up.
Poop belongs in a bucket, not on the ground.
The mussels can't get enough of this thing.
Not doin' me any good unplanted.
Need to get ahold of fish eggs for that.
Now we wait, eh, Lucy?
Hey Lucy, look. We've got a fish.
Those oughta cook up real good.
More of 'em, eh?
Can't even count'em all anymore.
Good for watering.
Buzzers!
Maple syrup substitute!
It needs a bit of help getting started.
There we go. Everyone needs a bit of help sometimes.
It's doing real well on it's own.
Doesn't need us no more.
That rotten log needs replacing.
If a log burns in the forest does it hurt my feelings? Yes. It does.
Everybody's got hardships, eh?
Sure makes the camp smell nice.
Well, should we eat?
Chops up food pretty good.
I'm not usually one for fancy spices.
All ground up.
I don't trust all this science stuff.
This is getting strange.
We can build these half as tall back home.
Rain makes the trees grow.
Weather's not going to get the drop on me now.
It's pretty like the northern lights.
Never did like this stuff.
How did it get burned?!
Well, it obeys some basic laws of physics.
The ones from home don't burn.
Its knowledge of rain didn't keep it from being burned.
Lazy thing.
Save the trees!
It craves wood.
I don't even begin to understand how this thing works.
Doesn't seem like the best place, but here I am.
Furiously icy! Reminds me of home.
It's pumping along nicely.
Gettin' low.
It'll give out any second.
It's hooped.
Could loosen some good tar with that right there.
Hrumph. A big production for a little metal.
Yep. That's a nice breeze.
I won't even pretend to know how that works.
Heh. Has a little compass and everything.
Looks like the map ends here.
Eh, I prefer to just wander around the woods anyway.
Oughta put a block of cut stone up there.
Back to whittling.
I'd prefer wood, personally.
I'm really more of a whittler.
I should probably use what's up there first.
Hm. Not bad, eh?
No sense having two of the same recipe.
It's good to be ready for anything at sea.
It looks a bit crispier than usual.
It seems a bit show-offy to me.
It lacks the heft of a good solid axe.
What a waste of good ham.
That looks hard to throw.
Sorry! Clumsy me!
Let's see what my huge lungs can do with this!
I can make my escape if I use this!
This seems a bit aggressive.
Will this give me hockey hair?
It's better than nothing.
It fits me so well!
It's hard to swing an axe while wearing this.
I don't know if the bees like this.
This seems a bit rough.
What did I say?
Plaid is all the armour I need.
That's mighty nifty.
I prefer to chop the trees myself.
This spear has a little extra bite.
Aim for a main vein, eh?
I'm gonna do some serious damage with this.
Time to run!
This is one skookum weapon!
That's a pretty neat little cutter, eh?
This is a hat befitting a Northerner.
This doesn't seem very hardy.
Makes me feel pretty tough, eh?
Pretty prickly protection, eh?
Well, it's no axe.
Pretty light, eh?
Nice use of bug carcasses.
I hope no one recognizes this guy.
This feels a tad psychotic.
It's a little cold.
Feel a little funny in this.
Yeesh. Bit of overkill.
Anyone want a demonstration of my impressive lungpower?
A couple blows on that and you can escape just aboot anything!
Pretty snappy looking.
Who needs a spear when you got ol' Luce?
Gross bird parts made an okay weapon, I guess.
I hope I don't hurt the little critters with this.
Some folks around here could use the shuteye.
Hope this shell protects me better than it protected the last guy.
It's where I try to make birds reform their evil ways.
Think aboot what you've done, bird!
They look so innocent when they dream.
A little duct tape would fix that right up.
It's bacon-stuffed.
Sorry! I'm not looking in!
Is it carrot flavoured?
I could sneeze it over.
I like the look of that!
Safe and secure, eh?
Wood is so handy! Look at all the things you can make!
Is there anything wood can't do?
It shows my love of plant life.
A mere shell of its former glory.
Is it roasted carrot flavoured?
Well that escalated quickly.
I miss the old you.
Wood does have a downside, though...
Gaudy if you ask me.
Wood is the best at burning.
Who knew sand could look so good.
Looks good.
Looks like a house fulla hosers.
Where the keeners sleep.
Why build walls when we could build bridges?
That's a wall, eh.
That doesn't look like a beaver dam.
A tiny portable dam.
Building dams is my specialty.
I'm ready for adventure, eh!
Looks hooped to me.
Floatin' through life. Got the right idea, eh?
How's it stay afloat when it's full?
Not quite as nice as a seaside cabin, but it'll do.
Just plop'r down wherever.
Good looking sea wall.
Kinda small, eh, Lucy?

Don't Starve Together
Birdcage BuildBirdcage- 
Where I try to make birds reform their evil ways.
Sorry! I'm not peeping, I swear!
I do love me some plant life.
I'll get you something to eat soon buddy.
He's got a hankering for some poutine!
I'm sorry. I failed you.
That's starting to smell.
Is there something wood can't do?
Let's give our neighbours some guidance.
Wood is the best at burning.
Good, sturdy wood.
What is this... some sort of sign?
I won't get it right unless I have the item in front of me.
Is there anything wood can't do?
Such a beaut of a wood table shouldn't be hidden by a cloth.
A little bit of nature makes everything nicer.
Aboot time we brightened this place up, eh?
We need bulbs, eh.
Well, that's that.
A burnt wood table.
He's doing the world a service.
Glad that's not me.
Great, now those feathered hosers are gonna run wild.
It's not much use like that.
Looks nice'n'sturdy.
I'm sweaty enough without help from a furnace.
It's hard to stay neat and tidy in the woods.
Wood is the best at burning.
Not so useful now, eh?
Ouch. Do I not look skookum enough already?
Better it than a tree.
Could you hand me my plaid shirt while you're in there?
A good project for a lazy afternoon.
That's a good lookin' fence.
Some nice woodwork there.
Ain't a tree, but ain't bad.
I'm from a Commonwealth, myself.
Sorry aboot your throne, there.
You look like you've got this under control.
It's all gone up in flames, eh?
Good for holding stuff to other stuff.
So smooth. You can really see the grain.
Part of the Canadian shield.
I'd rather chop than write.
It's nothing a good chopping wouldn't fix.
All of my fears in liquid form, eh?
Yeesh, that's waxy.
A good place to spit out your gum.
How do I dye it plaid?
I crushed up that pretty coral to make this.
What was in it?
Uncomfortably smooth.
Too small to chop right now.
I think it's missing something.
The magical fruit.
Why'd we go and ruin this perfectly good canvas?
I look good in wood.
I like to call it the 'Hat Machine!'
OK, I kind of get it now.
I only sing for Lucy.
What kind of darkness is that?
It makes me queasy to look at.
Nightmares can't hurt ye!
I stand on guard for thee!
A mouse with wings?
It tickles, I think it's still alive.
Just need a beverage to cool now, eh?
The sparkle is gone from the gem.
Always have a backup plan.
I don't trust this magic business.
It reminds me of home.
Just another use for wood.
I wonder what this thing does.
It's ready, but am I?
Needs gems, eh?
Looks ready.
It'll need a gem.
I don't look as good burnt.
This is why I don't use hat warmers.
Nope, lost it.
I'm amazed it makes such a crisp sound.
That's a funny lookin' contraption, eh?
Not so funny anymore.
I'm more of a guitar player.
Well that's neat.

Pugalisk WandPugalisk Wand- 
Freeze you colder than winter in Winnipeg.
That's where we came in.
It goes somewhere else.
This looks interesting eh, Lucy?
It moves all my stuff for me. That's nice.
Pretty roomy in there, eh.
All my buddies could be improved with wood.
That's a shame, that.
I don't trust any sort of magic business.
That's an odd looking tree.
Do I really need to be reminded of the moon during the day?
The moon's gone for now. Phew.
The moon's waxing again.
Not a good night to have a curse, but then when's it ever?
The moon's waning. Time for some peace and quiet.
We're free from the moon's reach down here.
Just aboot time again, Lucy.
Some sort of sandy transportation.
Get a move on.
Think I'm finally getting the hang of this, eh Lucy?
What's good for the goose is good for the woodsman!
Not bad, if I do say so mooself.
I'm pretty good at sewing.
Where I'm from these would only work in the fall.
It will keep the sun off my head.
Now I'm the king of the beefalo!
This will keep the bees out of my eyes.
I don't want to wear that... thing.
It's a nice toque, eh?
It's too fancy.
It's not plaid, but it'll do.
Nice and breezy.
This could stand up to the winters back home, eh?
It's good for hiding from nature.
I think it looks nice with my red hair.
It's good for the back country.
Traditional garb of a woodsman.
You can call me Mr. Melon.
I could chop this if I had to.
For chopping in the rain.
Always keep a dry head while chopping.
I'm still not convinced plaid isn't all-weather wear.
I really prefer plaid.
Always good to have something watching over you.
Now this is some proper winter gear.
I feel like a bit of a keener when I put it on.
Now would this be a 'touque' or a 'tuque'?
I feel so suave in it.
It's not very flattering, eh?
I feel right at home in this, eh.
You do what you gotta to survive.
Nothin' stinks when I got this on.
It's a speed toque, eh?
It's a hat made of teeth.
Double the protection!
Keeps my lungs clear.
It's tougher than a touque.
How do I look?
Where I'm from these'd only work in the fall.
It'll keep the sun off yer head.
That'll keep the bees out of yer eyes.
I want nothing to do with that... thing.
I think wildflowers look nice with my red hair.
Well, points for creativity.
Seems pretty useless.
That's easy on the eyes.
That there'll make you one with the forest.
Even when I take it off I can still imagine the texture.
Not sure it'll fit over my luxurious beard.
It's the wood of the caves!
Heh, stoned again eh?
Crumbling but still secure, eh?
I think it's off.
This thing just turned on!
It's vibrating!
It's going crazy!
It's settling down.
It's nearly still.
This'll make the chores go by quicker!
I could cut wood at night with this.
I've always been better at cuttin' anyways.
This will help me get around quickly.
Useful in a pinch!
This'll help me dismantle stuff!
It's... it's beautiful.
It's no toque, but it'll do.
That'll stop the hurt.
Metal on a stick.
This needs to be installed properly.
That'll drive the hosers off.
I get a bit of a weird feeling around these things.
My specialty!
Pitiful little boat.
Powered by elbow grease.
I'd prefer cargo shorts.
As safe as it gets, eh.
More 'crusty' than 'encrusted'.
Fancy, but it seems a little slow.
Patch'er up, eh?
I've got the wind in my sails.
This should help me get around.
Sailin' in style.
Seems touchin' all those gross feathers was worth it.
Looks speedy.
This'll blow'em up real good!
I've turned the seabird's evil against it!
I'm looking forward to a wobster dinner.
It's run clean dry, eh?
Open for business.
Needs topping up.
It's off.
It's running like a dream.
Fuel's low.
The fishes should swim right into this.
Come to me, fishes!
It's on its way down.
Nearly there!
Helps my eyesight, eh?
As easy as looking out over the plains of Alberta, eh.
I hope I don't go down with the ship.
It's the pirate's life for me now.
Could do with a pair of woolly earflaps.
Makes me feel safe.
Only good for a short trip.
It singes everything it touches.
An axe... with fire?! Watch out, Lucy, you've got competition!
This is one fiery spear.
Hot stuff, eh?
It packs a major punch.
I can hear the chimes of twenty-nine bells.
The Northern winds are at my disposal.
The power of the volcano is in my hand.
Well that's smart, eh?
For when you need a gentle touch.
Haven't done any prospectin' in a while.
Pretty clever.

Lamp Post (on)- 
A little bit of safe haven.
Not as good as a cabin in the woods.

The Sterling Trough Deli- 
I could go for some lunch.
I wouldn't mind popping in.
A decent healthcare system.
Want anything, Lucy?
I like this shop.
Some strange things in there.
All that magic stuff seems a little loonie.
Nothing in there as good you Lucy.
I wonder if they have toques.
I can smell the history.
What kind of loonie coins do they have in there?
I've been looking for something new to build.
Big shots in there.
We're all fancy, Lucy.
It's a guard contract. A handeshake'd do just as well.

Slanty Shanty BuildSlanty Shanty (owned)- 
Time to start choppin' wood for the fireplace.
Someone's gotta keep an eye out.

Don't Starve Together
Map ScrollMap Scroll (Cave)Map Scroll (empty)- 
Is it still a map if nothing's on it?
Giving it pats is relaxing.
Man and robot's best friend.
Heh, it feels like a beard.
Don't start no forest fires now, buddy.
Charmingly chubby.
Look, it's not you. It's me.
That's my little forest buddy.
Well, I did say I had a hankering for 'stone fruit'.
Kitschy. Just how Lucy and I like it.
Just a humble peasant, really.
Pfft, tacky.
I miss horses.
That's not really my sort of thing, eh?
Get ready, Lucy.
I don't tend to trust anyone without a face. Lucy excluded, of course.
Looks like a bit of a hoser.
Fine detail on that base.
Good use of stone.
Looks sturdy.
Good stonework.
Reminds me of nature.
Looks good to me.
Someone did a good job on this.
Looks kinda loonie.
Well, better get building.
Still not as good as Lucy.
I feel pretty safe with it in my hand.
Smells nice, like wildflowers.
It contains the base of the boat.
I wouldn't mind taking the boat out on the lake today.
Nice day for rowin', eh?.
This'll fix her right up.
'Little elbow grease and we'll have an anchor.
Better build it if we don't wanna row all day.

Steering Wheel KitSteering Wheel Kit- 
We should set up the base of the boat first.
That there ain't right.
I already know more than enough aboot those things.
Does it grow trees?
The perfect book for a full moon.
I know better than to mess with that, eh.
They don't have tentacles in Canada.
Makes me feel right at home.
Looks kinda fun if I'm honest.
Does it look like it's working, Lucy?
Woah! Careful, Lucy!
That's a right shame.
Fine, as long as it don't start no forest fires.
Looks like Winona's work.
Just about dead.
Plum tuckered.
Pretty odd looking gadget there.
All natural safety precautions.
A trap for the forest, by the forest.
Well. Plants gotta fertilize.
I suppose some spice couldn't hurt.
I prefer my syrup to be maple.
Yep. That's a spicy sauce.
Good fer melting ice, too!
That there bag could hold a whole heap of candy.
Even the stick is delicious.
Don't worry, I'll eat enough for the both of us, Lucy.
These ones don't puke. I like 'em.
Melts in your mouth, not in your hand.
I'll tell you what it tastes like, Lucy.
Yeesh. That's a lot of candy legs.
Not too bad, eh?
Just a regular ol' cob of corn.
Eh. I don't mind 'em.
Not sure that's food, eh?
Not the biggest fan of bugs.
It's pretty good stuff.
Lucy doesn't like it when I eat spice.
What a waste of wood, eh?
I'd rather my future be a surprise.
Doesn't even have a label.
More intimidating than beaver teeth.
That right there's a bad time waitin' to happen.
Creepy.
Looks like a pair of binoculars.
Oh, the gloves're comin' off now!
It's a snail-shaped scale, eh?
Got no idea what that's for.
Better than meeting a real one, eh?
Get along, lil gator.
Smashed to bits.
What sorta shows d'you think it gets?
I prefer to let mine air dry.
I prefer simpler things.
A good hardy drink.
That's a lot, eh.
Not bad.
It'll never replace a good hunk of wood.

Totally Normal RootTotally Normal Root- 
Hey there's a piece of wood in there.
Yep. That'll be a fine tree one day.
That's nice. I should hang it somewhere.
Argh! I'd sure like to hang a real one like that.
Hang in there, eh.
It's just fake, eh.
This would look good in a tree somewhere.
You wanna decorate, Lucy?
You see that, Lucy?
Glad that's over. Never thought I'd be scared of trees.
Should we do something nice today, Lucy?
They're just as fun to give as they are to receive.
I'm sure I have an extra pine cone somewhere.
Too bad. Made the place feel real cozy.
All holidays should revolve around trees.
Must... not chop...
Such senseless violence.
It's a gingerbread lumberjack.
That thing just ain't right.
Always had a soft spot for a good holiday cookie.
Satisfies the sweet tooth.
All the taste and none of the splinters!
Hard to complain aboot this whole 
Doesn't fall far from the cider tree.
Perfect for drinking next to a good fire, eh?
Psst, Lucy. Do I have a 'nog moustache?
For hanging on the unchopped tree with care.
What do you think, Lucy? Decorate, or chop?
Y'know, I do believe that was worth it.
Kinda familiar eh, Lucy?
That's nice.
I'm not giving anything to those birds!
Could use a touch of green.
It's all burnt up.
It's Lucy-colour.
I could use a bit of luck.
Let's not set them off in the forest.
This little light of mine.
It had to be birds, didn't it?
That's a sight, eh?
Nice needlework.
Well, somebody's gotta do it.
Nice and toasty.
Gotta warm this doghouse up, eh?
Burned up.
I usually do my own animal calls.
Earth hounds!
Someone carved each individual hair.
Look at the size of you.
Wonder where that sculpture came from.
Some plans for a fancy stone carving.
All the dog, none of the smell.
Not a wood sculpture, but it'll do.
Would ya look at that.
I think it needs meat, Lucy.
Burnt.
Want some, Lucy?
Doesn't look to appetizing. Sorry.
I don't need nothin' fancy.
Looks like something those pigs would make.
Sure likes that gold.
Too hot-headed if you ask me.
Something about that guy I like.
Looks a little blue.
Can't do that now. It'll be dark soon.
Could use a cleaning first.
I'll wait until the danger's passed.
He seems confused, eh?
I feel bad beatin' up such a little thing.
Keep them chompers to yourself.
Gotta keep that one from hiding, eh?
That acid'll be a problem, eh?
Mighty powerful right hook on that hoser.
Tough guy, eh?
They really like bumping chests like that, eh?
Gotta chop that armor up.
Don't trust that as far as I can throw it.
Let's head back to camp, Lucy.
Needs another piece.
Looks good.
Better keep an eye on that.
Let's chop that Battle Standard!
Better small spiders than big, I suppose.
What an odd little fellow.
Someone else'd put that to better use.
I'll leave it to someone more magic-inclined.
I'm leaving that to the experts.
I'd rather stick with my axe, thanks.
Packs a wallop.
I'd take a stab at it.
I could give it a whirl.
Something's different aboot you, Lucy.
I could use that.
I'm not much of a shot.
Someone else'll make better use out of it.
I'll leave that for someone else.
Won't do anyone much good.
Does nothing fast.
Better wood armor than nothin'.
Looks sharp, eh?
Good for a little recharge.
Looks pretty safe, eh?
No one'd push you around in that.
Better armor up.
I'd swing an axe a little harder with that.
I could do some real damage with that.
Get a loada that hat!
I don't think agility is my thing, eh?
They're reinvigorating rocks.
I don't see much use for that.
I oughta leave that for someone else.
That flower'd look nice with my beard.
That'll make ya quick on yer feet.
You fell like a tree, eh?
There we go.
Lucy'll never let me live that down.
I ain't too keen on that, eh?
We're in for a baa'd time.
How ya doing, kid?
Hey there!
How ya doin'?
Every society's gotta have a leader, I guess.
It's getting some shut-eye.
They seem like an alright sort.
Take it easy, eh?
It's a filthy pigeon.
It ain't living no more.
I don't see any reason to bother the poor fella.
No more berries.
Fresh underbrush.
Those mushrooms look mighty tasty.
Thank you for your sacrifice, tree.
The soil ain't right here.
It's not growing back.
Looks real flavourful.
That's been picked already.
It's beautiful!
Cut down in its prime.
Fillin' up, slow as molasses.
Thanks for the sap, tree.
Hey, get away from that tree will ya!
What troubles you, sister?
Pretty enough.
We gotta load it up with good eats.
It hasn't finished the food we gave it.
It was worth the risk, eh?
I'm not huge on art.
Sure are a lot of statues around here.
Huh. Wonder what happened here?
Kinda scary, eh?
Nothing left of a fireplace.
Too bad, eh?
That's a shame.
Such a shame.
That doesn't look right.
Not as pretty as Lucy.
To each his own.
Home sweet home, eh?
Just rocks, now.
Yeesh.
We need a key to open it.
In we go.
We just gotta grind and bear it.
This fountain's really old.
Can't chop that.
That must have taken some time to make.
Those scaly folks live in there.
No one'll miss it.
Locked tight.
What's for sale today?
Need some supplies, Lucy?
Wouldn't wanna swim in it, that's fer sure.
A fine monument to something.
It don't have an off switch.
Just wastes electricity.
Is that the right time?
Aw. Sorry, eh.
It's not gonna work like that.
Gotta hang the pot on the fire somehow.
It's all set up.
Wanna help me set it up, Lucy?
Be careful around that fire, Lucy.
That better not run on trees.
Better set this up.
Wanna BBQ, Lucy?
Ready for the May two-four.
I only know a handful of recipes, but I'm real good at them.
What do ya wanna make, Lucy?
Maybe I could test out some new recipes.
I'll just make something small.
It's good for the oven.
You have to have sap to make syrup.
Gotta set'er up.
Gonna be a bit longer.
It's ready.
Let's trap some crabs.
It's a farmer's life for me.
No use gettin' Lucy dirty.
Didn't I tell everybody trees were delicious?
Think it's for a safe.
Oh beauty, now we can open the gate.
Looks important.
This will keep us busy for a while.
Looks like new crop seeds to me.
Need a good cedar plank to cook it on.
Tastes like home.
That'll cook up real good.
I wouldn't mind a taste of that.
Probably won't taste great on its own.
We're gonna eat you.

GarlicGarlic- 
Homegrown.
Lucy helped.
I only cry tears of joy.
Perfectly roasted.
I love good local produce.
It cooked up real nice.
That's a nice looking tomato.
Heartburn city.
From the community garden.
Cooked real nice.
Such a fancy shade of gold.
Don't look like no flower to me.
Builds your bones.
Maybe I could chop it into smaller bits.
It's salty.
Tree sap. From a tree.
That's a shame, eh?
Not quite maple.
It makes my fingers smell like pepper.
You only need a pinch to get the flavour.
This coin could use a polish.
I'm gonna buy something nice for Lucy.
Not a Looney but I guess it works around here.
Nothin' like being owed a favour.
I'd say it looks good enough to offer.
I don't think it wants this.
Yep. That's what it wants.
Is this gonna be enough food?
Heh, whoops.
Kinda fancy eh, Lucy?
That's a fancy way to eat.
Guess we need a key.
This food is already on a dish.
Whoops. I used the wrong dish.
There's already something there.
That doesn't seem smart.
You see another key around here, Lucy?
Oops! Sorry. Someone's using that.
Guess those ingredients don't go together.
Too long on the fire.
It's over for us, eh.
We done did it.
It's calling to me!
Lucy would want me to chop it down.
Trees shouldn't fight back!
Ahhhh!
Another one!
It was a hard battle, but I won.
Nooo! I could have chopped it!
I'm sorry!
That's what you get for being spiky!
What a waste.
I feel terrible!
It deserved it.
Here comes a tree!
It makes it all worthwhile.
Oh no! The fruits of my labour!
This makes me a bit sad.
I should grow it and then chop it down!
Even Lucy can't chop that one down.
I feel conflicted, eh?
I am going to keep you, and call you Frank.
I want to see it grow so that I can chop it down.
Picking isn't as fun as chopping.
Aw! He barely had a chance!
Mmmmm. It's all twiggy.
I should build a tiny axe to chop these.
Looks like kindling.
It's gone all nubbly.
I need to poop on it.
I hope that doesn't spread to the trees.
It makes my eyes water.
I think I might be allergic to this.
Saskatoon berries?
No berries left!
It needs a good poopin'
Can't save it now.
Time for a little landscaping.
Reeds.
They'll be back.
Fire makes me nervous.
Want to hear my loon call?
I wonder what it will be.
A watched plant never grows.
Time for grub.
Plant.
That's a bramble.
Was that worth it?
Foomph!
I should plant this.
That's nice.
I wonder if Lucy would like these.
Something is wrong with that flower.
They're frowning at me with little evil faces.
I'm not one for vegetables, eh?
It's a red mushroom.
It's a green mushroom.
I can never remember which ones you can eat.
They have their own schedule.
I think I broke it.
That tree is calling to me!
Ahhhh!
Nooo! I could have chopped it!
What a waste.
Here comes a tree!
With this heat, it'll never grow to chopping size!
Maybe it'd thrive if it was cooler.
It's perished from the heat, eh?
It's got no life left, eh?
I should grow it and then chop it down!
That's gonna hurt.
It certainly did.
I wish it was sturdier so I could chop it.
Lucy's got too much kick for this.
The tree's call fills my ears!
It's just asking to be chopped.
That was some good choppin!
Those were good times.
Not as fun as a tree, but it was good chopping nonetheless.
Waste of a good chopping stump.
Burnt like bacon, eh?
What a waste.
Welp, that's not coming back.
You're coming with me!
Are you ready to go on a little trip?
Now we wait.
This could grow into a good chopping tree.
It's like diet wood, eh?
Sigh. Not a tree.
A bit damp, eh?
What're you, some sort of keener?
That's some seaweed, eh?
Looks tasty!
Hurts my hoser heart to look at.
Makes me pine for the lumber yards.
Now it's a tiny palm tree.
I use it for fanning myself.
It wants me to cut it down, I can tell.
That's a little plant.
That's some weird wood.

Should plant this somewhere.
Let's chop it!
Aw, that's pretty.
Don't trust that.
That's a real beaut.
Pretty nice, dontcha think Lucy?

Lily PadLily Pad- 
Nature's real good, eh?
I prefer wood sculpture.
It's a bush.

Intricate Topiary-

Aw. Somebody already chopped it.
Must be bushed.
Wood.
Doesn't look like we can chop it.
Tsk. Bad chopping form.
Sorry!
How terrible!
Oh no! Don't put another log on the fire!
I'll come back later.
I'll have to be patient.
Well, that's over.
It's calling to me!
Shucks, I'm gonna have to chop it again.
Done for.
Choppin's choppin'.
Another one!
I'm sorry!
I feel terrible!
I'd be lucky to get two chops out of that thing.
One day it'll make good chopping.
With a little care, this could make fer some good choppin'.
A poor excuse for wood.
Lookin' a bit down.
It's caught a bit of a bug.
I see a snack.
Eh, they'll be back.
Can't save it now.
Lookin' pretty barren.
This would be more useful somewhere else, eh?
Dry as the Albert plains.
Well lookit that. It sprouted.
Defo can't chop that.
Not very satisfying chopping, that.
That's a plant, eh?
There's a lot of water in there for such a tiny plant.
Look, sea plants.
Picked clean.
Seems a bit cruel, doesn't it?
The sea sucked all the good tree juice out of it.
Put it out of its misery.
Hasn't it been through enough.
It's over now.

Lune TreeLune Tree- 
Measure twice, chop once.
I might have chopped more than once.
Yeesh, that's a big blaze.
It burnt down, eh?
That's an awfully pretty blossom.
Welcome to the world.
Is that fruit?
It's a nondescript bush.
Ain't got nothing left in it.
It's pretty hot out.
It's smelling a little stinky.
That one might be a goner.
Well, that's no good.
Guess we didn't eat that one in time.
They're all comfy-cozy in there.
Why are those bees so angry?
I bet the bees worked their stingers off for this.
I know better than to mess with that.
It's covered with dog spit, eh?
I don't know if I should touch it.
Something is off aboot that rock, eh?
That makes sense.
Where did it go?!
I don't know how to move that.
You lost your head, eh?
Somebody must have built that.
Feels like a government building.
They're not the handiest.
Smells like a factory trawler.
What a waste of good pork.
How did they do that without thumbs?
That rock ain't going to move.
I could break it down if I tried hard enough.
Could make a decent little inukshuk with these.
This could be an axe head.
It's how we built the railway.
You can't make a coffee table out of gold. Well, maybe you can. But you shouldn't.
Someone was here.
Sorry! Don't haunt me!
Hey! A clue!
A large woodland creature passed this way!
The beastie got away.
The beastie is nearby.
It's a... magic thing, I think.
There are bits missing, eh?
It's almost ready, eh?
Ready to go, eh?
Ringy, eh?
Cranky, eh?
Boxy, eh?
Potato-y, eh?
That looks like a bum!
I'm not sure I want to look at that, eh?
It was gross in there!
I can't swim!
Sorry, friend.
Holy Mackinaw! Look at that thing!
Why would I want to carry that around?
I doubt there are trees down there.
Walruses are nearby, eh?
This won't be safe come winter.
Hey buddy.
Waste of good wood.
Justa bunch of junk.
A reminder of home for my pocket.
Home sweet home!
Back home, they never melt.
The beastie's tracks washed away.
I bet it's just a pile of rocks inside.
Nothing going in or out.
Couldn't even build a fireproof house.
Amazingly, it smells even worse now.
I'd like to complain to the chef.
Ugh, how many more lives do you have?
Good riddance.
That's a curious statue, eh?
It had some cool things inside, eh?
That's just downright unnerving.
That there won't float no more.
That's where my crabbit buddies live.
I'd prefer a log cabin.
They're not the handiest.
Couldn't even build a fireproof house.
If only it were a little colder out, would be a perfect spot for ice fishin'!
Come out, little guy.
Ripe for the picking.
Maybe I could crush it down to make something new.
What a tiny little hoser.
I could make a snack out of those.
Just a big rock, eh?
A little rearranging and it'd make a nice inukshuk.
Woah, cool it, eh.
Anything good inside?
It's a big pile of sand.
Sandy.
I think I hear meowing...?
Looks like just a bunch of sand to me, eh?
That's a doozy!
That looks a little suspicious to me.
I know you're down there, buddy.
I lost the trail. Sorry!
Where did the whale go?!
I was born to track beasts!
Yep. There's tar down there.
Stickier than tree sap, that.
Slower going than Toronto traffic.
Seems like a popular hangout spot for fishes.
I'm breaking a sweat just looking at it.
They want to be food.
I predict a mussel dinner in my future.
The spirit of the North guides my fate.
Kinda spooky, eh?
Thanks for the stuff, guy!
Where am I?
That's a box, eh.
Tough luck, buddy.
A pretty shell.
I think I'll give that a wide berth.
That looks dangerous.
Time to get digging!
What a nutter!
I hope to never end up in one of those.
A waste of good wood.
Nothing some duct tape wouldn't fix.
I should keep a hold of this.
There must be a use for this, eh?
Doesn't look anything like a potato. And I know potatoes.
Some sort of ring?
We should flip it.

Dung PileDung Pile- 
Dung gone it.
Dung to go.
The nest of those electrical guys.
I wonder how long it's slept.

Iron Hulk (hand, inactive)- 
No axe in that hand.

Iron Hulk RibsIron Hulk (ribcage, inactive)- 
It's only full of iron, not wood.

Iron Hulk (foot, inactive)- 
Somebody lost their leg, eh?

Iron OreIron Ore- 
Can't chop this too well.
What's that shiny stuff in there?
Look at all that gold!
Industrious little guys, eh Lucy?

Rusty Lamp-

That's nice.
The poor bees probably worked their stingers off on this.
I'm more of a woodsman than a hunter anyway.
A tiny reminder of home.
I'd like to complain to the chef. Politely.
That'd be the thing I fell through, eh.
Nature is something else, eh?
I'm not eating honey off the ground.
The bees are planning something.
Just a big hunk of stone, as far as I'm concerned.
I don't get art. Whattaya think, Lucy?
Once you've seen one weird statue, you've seen 'em all.
Looks a bit like one of them chargin' hosers.
Creepy.
Yikes. Put it back in.
As if I didn't have enough reasons to hate full moons.
Whose bright idea was it to fix this thing?
Just needed a little duct tape.
Is stone supposed to move like that?
I wouldn't get too close to that, eh?
Boulder-dash.
Yikes.
I'm not sure I get it.
She's a real tall one, eh?
I prefer wood carvings.
Could make a nice planter outta that.
It's uh, a moon rock.
I should probably put this down somewhere, eh?
Wonder where it goes.
That'll need more than a roll of duct tape to fix.
I'd rather not muck with that if I can help it.
I'm happy to just leave it there for now.
That oughta keep us cool.
Looks a little off.
That's in a pretty sorry state, eh?
So... senseless.

Rock DenRock Den- 
Anyone home?
Poor %s. %s got him, eh?
Poor %s. %s got her, eh?
Poor %s. %s got them, eh?
Poor %s. I should watch out for %s, eh?
Not my style.
I really wish I hadn't seen that.
Just a big hunk of marble, that.
That's a heavy lookin' hoser.
That doesn't seem right.
Hmph. Maybe I don't got it so bad.
That's unfortunate there, buddy.
Something good's in there, eh?
That's a whole lotta wet.

Cave-in BoulderCave-in Boulder- 
Some elbow grease'll move those, easy.
Can't reach that one.
Just a little starfish, eh?
Well, that's just dangerous.
I should find a place to put it.
It wants to show me something.
Oh great, now I'm really hearing voices.
I think it wants one of those moon fissures.
It wants me to carry it somewhere.
It wants me to take it to one of those cracks in the ground.
Oddly inviting, isn't it?
That's a crack in the ground, eh?
Careful Lucy, wouldn't want you to rust.
Lookin' purdy.
Wonder if I could bust through that.
Let's wait an' see if it fills up again.
There's a little whisper coming from inside.
That's a big hunk of moon stuff.
It's green, like a nice leaf.
Smells ripe.
It's a sea stack.
Better not disturb it.

Compromising Statue- 
This here'll save my back bacon.
It's bunged up.
There're probably no trees down there anyway.
It looks like Sudbury down there.
Maybe later. I've gotten cozy down here.
There are probably trees up there.
Maybe I should chop it.
It's made of wood.
I can't let that stand.
Shiny!
It looks chewy.
I'm not too interested in rocks.
I should skedaddle before they come out of there.
Are you guys doing OK in there?
What a fine choice of building materials.
Hey! It's a fern!
Looks like a salad.
They don't have those back home.
Such a waste.
Smells worse than my long underwear in there.

Don't Starve Together
SinkholeSinkhole (full)- 
More crowded than a Toronto subway!
Sorry! I'll wait til you're all done up there!
Full of the little critters!
I like the colour of this one.
Well I can't cut it down now...
Chop it down before it spreads!
This one needs pruning, at least.
A floating red pinecone!
We've been visited by a forest sprite, Lucy!
A flying blue pinecone!
One day this might be a tree.
Someone's got a brown thumb.

FossilsFossil Fragment- 
Brittle.
Still got some work to do, looks like.
Eh... Should we try again, Lucy?
One hundred percent assembled beastie.
That's gotta be rebuilt, eh?
Didn't work. Probably for the best.
It's all bunged up.

AncientAncient FaceAncient Statue- 
Another hoser.
Looks a little worn out.
There's axe marks on these altar stones.
Doesn't look edible.
Dead metal.
What's this all aboot?
I don't plan on fixin' that.
It's not wood but it'll do.
Looks barely edible.
What's in the box?!
That's a nice chest with horns, eh.
They should have used wood.
It makes my beard hair stand on end.
It's thinkin' real hard.
We didn't cut it, Lucy.
Thanks'm.
Where d'you think it goes, Lucy?
It's soaking up energy, hey?
That oughta do it.
That'd be my cue to leave.
Don't wanna overdo it.
It probably said something important. Oh well.
Gotta be a way to turn it on.
What a nightmare.
It's an old drawing of strange creatures.
Nothin' of interest left here.
Black muck is covering everything in this drawing.
Don't look at this one, Lucy.
Looks like a bustling city.
Was it supposed to be holding something?
I can make some fiery tools here, eh?
Coffee beans!
I wish it had more beans.
You look a little down, bud.
It could use good cuppa joe.
I'm going to take you everywhere with me.
Watch out! That plant's gonna give'r!
It's prickly, eh?
This cactus gave'r. Now it's tired.
Are you headed my way?
Hoo-boy. That's sharp.
There's a fire burning within it.
It's a little toasty.
It makes my hands all sooty.
Well, it's definitely not an evergreen.
Rude.
Are you OK in there, buddy?

What should I wish for, Lucy?
That well's been contaminated.
Looks like it's the end of days.
Not my idea of a model home, but to each his own.
That's neat.
That's sweet.

32pxStalacmite Throne- 
There's stuff in there, eh?
Too fancy for my taste.
Oh. Fancy.
Real heavy one there.
Waste of good wood.
Better plug that up soon or we'll be swimmin'.
Must... not... chop...!
Hopefully we don't have to abandon ship.
I like to know where I'm going.
Flooring fit for a king!
Too classy for my taste.
Looks like one of those city-people outhouses.
Just some ground, eh?

Fire doesn't quite take here, eh?
Just some ground, eh?
Maxwell's own mounted police.
It's been a while since my last confession.
Hmm... does the rook move in a straight line? I forget.
Doesn't look to be in the best of shape.
I can see the internal workings!
The gears are spilling out.
Who's there, eh?
Yeouch! That was rough!
They'd be good at pulling a sled.
Hot hound!
Arctic hounds?
Beauty, eh?
That's the biggest spider I've ever seen!
They come in yellow now, eh?
Careful, now, eh?
I don't want to wake it.
Good!
Great!
I think it's poison.
Spiders give me the willies.
Back off, hoser!
I feel bad taking someone else's sack.
What foul sea did that crawl out of?
I don't trust anything that can't decide between air and water.
It's tired.
Ex-frog.
There a squid down there?
It wobbles when you wave it.
I'm blushing!
It's so big!
I'm tired of these squids!
Not even a stump left behind!
Are those squid babies?
I don't want to make him mad.
Happens to the best of us.
Boo! Ha ha!
Oh no. Walruses again!
Why are they so far South?
He had a cavity, eh?
My granddad wore a hat like this.
That'll take a pint out of me!
What do I do with this, eh?
Blood and guts, eh?
Skeeters!
Tricky devil!
Spitting is rude!
Who taught that rat to fly?
Is that meat?
It's warm and lumpy.
It needs to mind its own business.
I think it's living hair.
Looks like a dead beaver.
They're smart to live away from the corruption.
WOOORM!
I know a plant when I see one. This'n an impostor!
Be wary the moving ground.
That thing could pull a sled by its lonesome.
You're due for a chopping.

BirchnutterBirchnutter- 
I'll chop you too!
Those're some nasty chompers.
Woah now, buddy.
Really has that 'wet dog' smell.
That guy's got an attitude problem, eh?
Gross.
Eye'll get you!
Maybe he's friendly?
It's dripping with disease.
It smells a little sour.
It's okay, as far as serpents go.
I'd rather not get bitten by that.
I'm sure the snake didn't need this.
They come in yellow now?
You're snoozin' fer a bruisin'.
Great!
Not gonna make a buddy of that one, that's for sure.
Smells worse than a waterlogged moose, eh!
That there's one pointy fish.
It's strong, and very free.
Well, he's dead now.
Seems a little hot under the toque!
You ever see something like that before, Lucy.

Gnat SwarmGnat Swarm- 
Lotta those guys in the lumber camps.
Don't trust that.

Masked PigMasked Pig- 
He looks a little shady.
Neat.
So that's where he hid everything.
Don't like the look of that guy.
Seems mighty angry.
Keep out of my boots.
Lookit them chompers.
That's a big one there, eh?
He's lookin' for a kerfuffle.

Spider Monkey DeadSpider Monkey (dead)- 

Vampire BatVampire Bat- 
Your'e a bit batty, eh?
Let sleeping bats lie, I say.
It's a goner.
I'm sure I could use this for something.
Rather keep away from that guy.
Worse than blackflies.
That'll teach 'em!
Never did care for horses.
You're snoozin' fer a bruisin'.
Seems wrong to take someone else's sack.
That one looks like he means business.
My granddad wore a hat like that.
Reminds me of momma!
That'll put the shine back on my axe.
That ain't natural.
Hopefully no one's allergic, eh?
Death by axe!
I don't like the looks of that.
It's better this way.
What on earth is happening?!
That just ain't right.
Let's not wake it.
It's dead.
It's like a bird, but worse.
Let's not wake it.
Good riddance.
I don't want nothing to do with whatever that is.
Let sleeping dogs lie, eh?
It's dead, eh?
He smells like a sod house.
I think he likes me.
He's catching some zeds.
Cheer up, eh?
I like this one's attitude.
You're almost as big as a moose!
I'm sorry, want to go for a ride?
Why so glum, chum?
It feels like my beard.
I don't know if I should put my mouth on that.
A face only a mother could love.
I like to sleep outside, too.
Bees! Bees!
She's making the flowers grow.
That bee doesn't seem as friendly.
Now what do I do with it?
He's none to pleased with his situation.
Ouch! It's pointy.
Walking back bacon!
We're a team! Yah!
Not a pig anymore.
Bacon with a tail.
He looks friendly enough.
I feel sorry for him.
He looks tasty.
They get tastier in the winter.
Take off, beauty! To the Great White North!
Lobster supper time!
He's just misunderstood.
Spirals!
Someone needs a tissue.
I broke his home. I feel bad.
This will keep my noggin safe.
You can never be too safe.
Well then. That's a new one.
Stay away from my meat snacks!
Pests.
The end of that cat's tale.
That's a nice pair of horns you've got there.
Nice goat, nice goat!
Your horn is mine.
Give'r!
That's a big guy, eh.
Hey buddy, you know any tricks?
Definitely not ballphin-free.
A little jellyfish buddy.
That's a jellyfish, don'tcha know.
Poor guy's the butt of every yoke.
It used to be attached to an ox.
This guy's a bit of a keener.
Looks like a total hoser.
He's looking for a fight.
Reminds me of something I saw in Algonquin Park once.
Yep. That's a big one.
How ya doin' there, buddy?
Snoozing.
Out of his misery.
Doesn't he get dizzy?
What'aya think this is for?
Oh, hey there little guy.
Seems like an upstanding sort.
I don't know if anyone should put their mouth on that.
I feel sorry for it.
Doesn't matter if you're from the Great White North. Still a bird.
His home is broken now. Oh.
That could sure keep a noggin safe.
Stay away from those meat snacks!
I'm sure the goat didn't need it.
Just a sweet little critter.
Were you always that colourful?
I'll let it rest.
I never trusted those things, eh?
Where are you going to run?
He's planning something. I can tell.
You'll pay for your crimes, crow!
What a snotty little jerk.
Don't get comfortable, birdie.
Go fly south or something!
It's stealing my warmth.
A gross feather.
A disgusting feather.
A stupid feather.
More birds! Why is it always birds?
No one ever told him it was rude to stare.
I wonder if it will ever wake up again.
This used to be an eyebone.
He's doing his best!
Dang ground squirrels...
I'd feel bad eating him.
Reminds me of Algonquin park.
I've got a pocket full of sunshine!
It's looking at me.
What have I done?
Sorry, little guy.
Sorry!
Was that a bad thing to do?
Ow. What was that?
Keep flapping, little guy!
Even the flower is slimy.
Dead and still slimy.
This used to be a slimy flower.
Unsurprisingly, the wings are slimy.
Yep, his slime is slimy too.
Dig, dig, dig.
It feels aboot rocks the way I feel aboot trees.
Want some rocks?
Just like the Northern Lights.
Maybe we could be buds?
Can't hide forever, bud.
Nice doggy.
Just a big sweet kitty cat, eh?
This better not attract any feathered vermin.
It's all burnt up.
I can tolerate him.
Floating along.
Are you edible, little buddy?
Shoo, filthy featherbag!
I'd rather not smalltalk with a birdbrain.
Vermin of the sky.
Vermin of the sea.
That thing looks shifty.
Filthy scoundrel.
Not too sure how this awful thing survives.
Those filthy birds breed here.
It's nothing like the plumage of the proud Canadian goose.
Looks like good eating to me.
Well, can't do nothing aboot it now.
Could use a side of Canadian bacon.
It's filthy.

Shagged out after a long squawk.
Pushin' up the daisies.
Horrible vermin.
They're never really sleeping you know.
Good.
There's a bit of a stink.
I don't think she liked that.
Getting some shut eye.
It's a goner.
Thanks for lightin' the way, buddy.
Looks expensive.
Filthy animal!

Poor little critter...
Watch out!
Look at this!
This is the worst thing.
Where's the log lizard?
I've never had one of these before.
It was bound to happen.
Friendly lil' guy, eh?
Degenerate.
Want a peek at our prisoner, Lucy?
Diseased vermin.
A grody feather.
That's my lil' critter.
Look how happy she is!
Poor gal's getting hungry.
Skinnier than a blue heron's legs.
There's a fire burning in there.
Cozier than a moose wrapped in duct tape!
She could use a parka.
Not as sharp as Lucy!
Lil buddy cooled right off.
That's a creature of the woods, eh?
Something's different aboot you...
Wish I still had a cabin I could mount these things in.
Filthy feathered menace.
It's my prisoner.
Do you think you're cute? You're not.
That carrot's a rat!
I gotcha now.
Huh. It's sleeping.
It's dead.
Pixie dust tickles my nose.
I sure do like nature.
I don't trust birds that can't fly, either.
I should steal its egg to teach it a lesson.
Nothing there.
What's in here?
It tastes like justice.
It's hatching.
You can taste the beak, eh?
Is it crying?
Too cold for you?
Birds are never prompt.
Any time now.
What do you want?
It wants something.
I think it's starving.
It's growing up to be a jerk, just like its parents.
Are you ALWAYS hungry?
It getting wild with hunger.
Sorry! I'll try harder!
Anytime now.
I'm sorry aboot all of those trees!
You're not my queen!
She's a real beaut, ain't she?
That's a big moose!
Now what is this good for?
Another poor soul with a curse.
That's a nice horn, eh.
That's a big bear!
It's as thick as my head!
Whatever it is, it's definitely Canadian.
Well, it lays eggs, apparently.
Feathery moose baby!
Pillowy plumage.
He will burn all the trees before I can chop them!
I still don't believe in dragons.
Aaaah! Tree killer!
My trees are safe now.
I've angered the forest!
For Lucy!
A bit grabby, don'tcha think?
Show me the loot!
A nightmare made real.
'Tis the witch of November come stealin'.

SealSealnado (seal form)-

Fish lungs.
Whoa. That guy's in a hurry.
A good bone's always good for somethin'.
Gotta be useful for something.
Pretty big, eh?
How d'you do, ma'am?
It's nice to be appreciated.
How's it goin'?
Looks important. I should hold on to it.
Yep. That's a big one.
I still prefer wood.
Where's the pyromaniac? This needs to burn.
Bees got no business getting that big.
Hmph. Real regal.
Thing's got no eyes, eh?
You shoulda stayed down.
Gotta be some use for that.
It isn't polypore-sonal, I just gotta chop you.
It's a hole.
Is that how trees are born?
I'm gonna need a bigger axe.
Alright, enough playin' around! Get'em Lucy!
Mushrooms don't have no reason to be that big.
I don't like the look of that.
That's gross.
It's a walking anatomy lesson.
You'll have to do better than that.
That's just impolite eh.
Ain't no reason for that to exist.
Sticks to yer ribs.
That right there's a cursed object, eh?
Someone's trying to give us a leg up.
No more luring I guess.
Why does he hate me?
He's not MY king.
Who's that hoser?
That ain't right.
Watch where you're stepping!

That critter's in a real bad mood.
S'got a powerful stink, eh?
Time to get a move on.
That's something else, eh?
Some good craftsmanship.
I wonder if it chops.
Well it ain't wood.
We're all connected, eh?
%s! Hey buddy!
You haven't been very gentlemanly lately, %s.
Enemy of the forest!
%s, you're an alright guy.
Someone should rub a heart on %s.
Was that blaze some sort of experiment, %s?
Look who it is! %s!
You're tempting a forest fire, %s...
Here comes the wildfire!

That's some good work ya did, Ma'am.
You know where I can get a heart, %s?
Careful around those open flames, Ma'am.
%s! Fancy seeing another Canadian here.

Hey, c'mere %s! I've gotta AXE you question!
%s is a Canadian patriot, eh.
Canadians gotta stick together, %s. Let's get a heart.
Been there, bud.
You're gonna have one monster of a headache after this, buddy.
Yeesh, is that really what I look like?
Hang on bud, we'll get you sorted out.
Truly Canada's most ferocious beast.

A bit rough around the edges, but you're alright %s!
We'll get ya feeling right as rain in no time.
Hey! What do you think you're doin?
Look who it is! %s!
%s isn't very polite...
Enemy of the forest!
%s, you're an alright sort.
Someone should rub a heart on %s.
Knock off the fire starting there, bud.
There's an evil bird in there thinking evil bird thoughts.
Well, at least it never became a bird.
Tastes like moose.
Just like my dear old ma used to make.
It tastes like survival.
I wish this were bigger.
That'll just make me hungrier!
Just a bite.
I'm not hungry enough for that.
I still don't want to eat it.
That's gross!
Cooking it didn't help much.
October food.
Thanks, turkey.
Looks like a cod.
I wish I had some chips.
This should cook up nicely.
This cooked up nicely.
It's pretty thin.
It's thick and hairy.
I think it boiled off all of the nose cheese.
They're still jumping!
At least they stopped moving.
Gross!
Gross! And tasty! So confusing!
It wants to be dinner.
Sorry, guy.
Are you ready to become fish'n'chips?
The life's all but drained out of it, eh?
I think this is as edible as it gets.
I don't think my little buddy's getting up anytime soon.
As good of eating as anything around here.
Jerky! The food of my people.
I'd prefer salmon.
Lucy'll open'er up.
I wish I had some chips.
Hope I don't attract bears, eh?
Looks good to me.
Some sort of water-dwelling snail, eh.
Dinner's on.
Those look like good eatin', eh?
These look tasty.
A handful of future fish, eh?
Better eat'em before they go bad.
Nice colours on that one.
Looks like I'll be eating for a day.
Always did like fishing.
Mmm, roast fish.
Looks like dinner.
Caught and cooked it myself.
I'm sure the shark won't miss this.
He's thoroughly hooped.
Good eats!
What on earth is that!
The heart of the beast.
Those legs look toxic.
I don't know, eh...?
Met a lot of those guys in the Rockies.
How hungry am I?
Could use some chips.
I was hopin' it'd be bigger.
Just a tiny little guy, eh?
Doesn't look like there's a lot of meat on that one.
Just a small fry!
Weird looking fish, but sure smells good.
Yeesh, if I weren't so hungry I'd throw it right back.
You'll make a good meal.
Never seen a fish so pointy before.
Don't recall ever trying catfish. First time for everything!
Now that's just confusing.
I have a heartier appetite than that.
Tastes like warm berries.
It tastes tropical.
I cooked it for some reason.
I've never seen one of those before.
It tastes like maple syrup.
It smells bad.
It smells even worse.
That's too fancy for me.
This would go good on flapjacks.
How can it be both water and melon?
I'm not sure aboot grilled fruit...
It tastes tropical.
I cooked it for some reason.
It's a coconut, eh.
I turned one coconut into two!
Ready to eat, eh.
I should cook these up.
I'm addicted to this, eh.
Now it's a warm mush.
That's good eatin', eh?
Mmm. With some syrup these'd be perfect.
That's rabbit food.
I like it, but not in everything that I eat.
Cooked with the goodness of corn.
I bet birds have something to do with this.
Suspiciously birdy.
I don't like to eat things that grow on the ground.
Pies are good.
I don't know...
Only if I get really hungry.

Dön't let the beast entertain thöughts öf escape.
The beast returned fröm whence it came.
Victöry! All right, let's gö.
Chop and chop.
Life is okay when you've got a golden axe.
Maybe we can tunnel our way out?
We're gonna dig so many holes.
Rocks will be ours!
The finest pickaxe of them all.
I watched my father use one of these.
Chaos and destruction!
A good tool to play in the dirt.
Haha! It tickles!
It's more scratchy than anything.
We ride!
We'll have lots of fun riding on this.
It's a saddle made out of spidersnacks!
Leaves the beast nakey.
We really regret licking it. Blech.
Hyah! Hyah!
What a beautiful blade!
It's for chores like trimming hedges or cutting grass.
Wonder how heavy our fish is!
Sure beats the cold. And darkness.
That fire is huge!
Nice and warm.
The fire's getting a touch low.
We should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Well, that's done.
Well, that's done. But not forever!
This should keep us safe.
A handy light for our head.
Just like we used to make at home!
We have captured the sun.
Sure beats the heat. And darkness.
That fire is huge!
Nice and cool.
The fire's getting a touch low.
We should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Well, that's done.
Well, that's done. But not forever!
I can see for miles and miles.
Our fires can stay safe from the wind's clutches.
Hey in there little buddies, thanks for the light!
It will light my way!
Seeing where we're going is sure handy!
We made the fire stones into a fire home!
That fire is huge!
The toastiest of fires.
The fire's getting a touch low.
We should put something on the fire before it goes out.
Well, that's done. But not forever!
We could burn some tar for light.
We used coral to corral the fire!
Woah! It's so hot!
The fire's burning alright.
The fire's kinda low.
It's not very hot.
Fire's gone!
Cool hat! Now our hands are free.
Cool. Now we're like a Bat Spider Boy.
The sun's trapped in there.
It sees for miles and miles.
It still needs to be turned on.
It's giving off a nice light.
Well that's no fun-gus.
Maybe the night won't be as scary now.
We love all the colors!
Aw. It was kinda growing on us.
Lighter than what?
It's like a second abdomen we can store things in.
It holds so much stuff!
Come to our web trap, birds!
Good thing we're an arachnid.
I miss grandpa's fishing trips.
Musty but relaxing.
I miss being able to properly feel a nice bedroll.
We should get some rest.
Now we can catch some food!
A bandage for our booboos.
Soothing.
This should keep some of the rain off of us.
North!
South!
East!
West!
Northeast!
Southeast!
Northwest!
Southwest!
No reading!
Let's cocoon something for later!
But what should we wrap up?
That's one of my favorite things!
I can bear this pack!
This thing is huge!
Is it nap time?
We can't take a nap, it's nighttime!
Can't nap with monsters nearby!
Time for a snack.
No naps til daybreak!

Tent BurntTent (burnt)- 
The fire destroyed it.
We can't take a nap in that!
It's a rock.
It's cold to the touch.
It's getting chilly.
It's getting hot!
It's hot to the touch!
It won't keep us from playing in puddles!
Helps carry goodies!
A booty bundle.
Eww, it's wet and squishy.
This thing is huge!
We've made a friend!
It won't keep us from playing in puddles!
This is medicine?
Almost as good as a spider nest.
For those little bugs.
Now we can sing to the little birdies.
It's way past our bedtime!
Bandages for booboos.
Should keep some of the rain out.
It's fuzzy!
Rain won't keep us from playing in puddles!
I think it loves me.
I hate taking my medicine!
We have to be gentle with our claws if we try to hold it!
It cools us when we run, how nice.
Just in case someone's lost and lonely.
A teddy bear.
That teddy bear is moving!
It's creepy and cute at the same time!!
It's all busted up.
I'm sure Mr. Warly won't mind if we use this!
Food goes in, other food comes out.
It won't be done for a while.
Almost ready!
Supper is served.
That can't go in there.
It's a box with bees in it.
There's no honey inside.
Work faster, bees!
It's full to brimming.
I'll have a go at this farming thing.
C'mooon, plants!
We're master farmers!
The soil is dried up.
Spoil not, food supplies!
It's not doing us much good empty!
Is it done yet? I'm hungry.
Food time!
Someone must have left the fire going.
The site of The Great Honey Fire.
A razed farm is no farm at all.
It's hard to dry when it's raining.
Fire takes all.
I saw mum use this in her gardens.
The mussels do pull ups on this.
They'd be happier in the water.
No fishies.
We drew the sign ourself.
A fish! It looks lonely.
Fish friends!
So many fish!
A whole school! Let's give them homework.
Let's run through it.
There aren't any mushrooms.
Aw, they're so little.
They look happy.
Wow! So many mushrooms!
It's all yucky.
Fire's dangerous, I guess.
You look chilly.
Makes yummies!
Mmmm! Let's eat!
Shake-a, shake-a, shake-a!
Oh! Can we grind it, please?
All done.
It's like a science lab in here!
Father used to work on something like that.
How hot is it, Mr. Thermal Measurer?
It must be powered by magic.
This might keep us safe.
It looks all glowy!
We're getting good at making stuff.
I think it's broken.
All our work- gone.
Another dead friend.
I don't think that's accurate.
It's off.
This would come in handy in a snowball fight.
Running low on fuel.
We are getting good at crafting!
We keep dropping our tools in the water by accident.
Ice is useful in this heat.
It's running pretty good!
I think it needs our help.
This thing's on its last legs. Maybe it can borrow some of ours.
Dead.
It might help us find more tar.
Yeesh, that's hot!
That breeze feels nice on our fur.
This black powder stuff packs a punch.
All our work... gone.
How come everything turns to ashes? It's sad.
A very well crafted doodad!
Heh heh. I was never allowed in father's study.
Ohh no, uh, oh no!
That's probably why I wasn't allowed in father's study.
I always wanted pottery lessons!
Aww. Can we make another one?
Eight legs isn't nearly enough to sculpt with THAT.
Oh! There's so many possibilities!
Mom always said to finish my plate before seconds.
Wow! It looks great!
We don't need two!
There's all kinds of fun things you can do at sea.
Fire is very dangerous.
It gives me a goal in life.
We should stick things with the pointy part.
An interesting way to use food.
Boomerangarangarang!
It hurts us when we don't catch it.
Same as blowing bubbles.
Airborne sleeping agent.
One step above blowing hot air.
We could be good at football, much better than I was!
It just feels like more hair.
Wood you like to fight?
Marbelous protection!
Would you bee mine?
This will hurt our enemies.
Another creature casing.
Night light, night bright!
We'll huff and we'll puff.
One jab'll do ya.
A sneaky weapon...
This will be so fun!
Fire in the hole!
Why would anyone launch a spear? Someone might get hurt.
There's something fishy about this sword.
How do we look?
We feel like a knight in not so shiny armor.
Our back hurts...
Weaponized hugs!
Swoosh!
Coach said we're not allowed to cork a bat.
For when we need protection.
This seems a little mean.
We could always use a spare thorax.
A fancy helmet to protect our head.
Now we're Sir Webber!
Whoa. This looks pretty dangerous.
Haha! It's way too big for us!
Pointy ouchies!
It's a shock to the system.
Oooh, it makes so much noise!
Throwable nap time!
We look like a hermit crab!
It's the jail.
Jailbird.
You have to sleep to survive in the jail.
A tall house for a fat pig.
I can see a pig through the window!
Why do they hate me?
Just like grandpa said, 'You live in what you eat.'
Some grass tied together.
This will keep all sorts of things out!
They won't keep us safe if we keep holding them.
Like a pillow fort, but wood!
These should come in handy.
We're base-building masters!
We could keep our toys in it!
We could write on that if only we had a pen!
Mum would like this nice fern.
Let's build it!
Can someone lend us a pencil?
But what should we draw?!
That looks nice!
Let's build a fence!
I don't think we can jump over that.
Let's build a gate!
The hinges are a little squeaky.
Not so fancy now, pig!
A little overdone and overlarge.
It didn't keep the fire out.
Turns out wood burns really well.
It won't be very useful to us now.
It looks like my old toy chest!
The lettering burnt off.
That was fun!
We wish we could live inside.
Muffled oinking is coming from inside.
Too many monkeys.
Why is it called limestone? It's not even green.
Is this wall made of limes?
Maybe we'll leave that alone.
Remember to lift with your legs... all eight of them!
Sand pillows!
Let the adventure begin!
Bye-bye!
I'm a little buoy too!
We could keep our bath toys in it!
We'll just stay over here... and watch...
We could put this down on the water.
Maybe the rubber blobs would like a playpen!
That'll be good for something.

Don't Starve Together
Pig House BuildPig House- 
A tall skinny house for a short fat pig.
Bow to the base-building masters!
He looks hungry.
We need to feed him.
We weren't very good wardens.
Eww.
Ooooh, what should we say?
The lettering burnt off.
Reminds me of antique shopping with mother.
Looks great!
Nice and bright!
It's gonna go out soon.
They look sad.
Antiques are dumb, anyway.
Let's play dress up!
Someone should address this.
He got dressed down.
We thought 'moon' meant something totally different!
We feel safe behind this wall... it makes us sleepy...
Hot hot furnace!
We like to pop out and scare our friends sometimes. Haha!
Fire fire fire!
We can't hide in there any more.
Not right now, we're comfy.
Woah! Hot fashions!
We'll give them some privacy while they change.
I wonder if mum's ever seen one.
Hey, can we be the king? We can take turns!
Yikes! What happened?
Can we help?
It's burnt up!
We could tie stuff up with this.
Logs, but flat.
Squared rocks.
We could do our homework.
I can see knowledge swimming inside.
It's cold and slippery.
This stuff gives me hives.
Why have paper you can't draw on?
We could make a new blankie. Or not.
So bumpy...
We wish this was filled with soda pop.
It'll grow some hair soon.
I bet it'll grow up big and strong.
Haha. It's heavy!
Bean there, done that!
We used our nicest spider silk!
Who is that supposed to be?
Did I just hear a squeak?
We should be careful around that.
A well constructed instrument.
It makes our skin crawl.
I'm a bit uneasy wearing this, but it's effective.
Are you seeing this too?
We need to practice more.
Flap that bat like you were born to do it.
Squeeze our tummy tight!
I guess it's nice.
Did you hear something?
It's a fine necklace, I suppose.
We didn't start the fire.
It makes me feel funny.
It makes my brain feel fuzzy.
Seems ready to use.
It needs something to focus the power.
Looks good.
Looks empty.
It will be of no use to us in that state.
Smells like cooking.
The fires care not for magic.
Exactly the right amount of bell.
This is definitely a thing.
All burned up!
It's just begging to be played!
Yay! More things to learn!

Pugalisk WandPugalisk Wand- 
We could have a staring contest with that scary big snake.
I hope it goes somewhere cool.
That leads somewhere else.
Neat! We can be a robot!
Now we don't have to carry our stuff everywhere.
Kinda like a security blanket. But also kinda scary.
It's a giant doll of our friend!!
It's a bit uneasy wearing this, but so effective.
Just looking at it makes my brain feel fuzzy.
Woah! I bet it sees so far!
Hey, Ms. Wicker! How come we can still see the moon?
New moon! Neat!
The moon is growing!
Wow! Full moon!
The moon is shrinking!
The moon can’t fit in a cave! I think.
Floaty and weird.
I hope no one gets a headache.
It looks just like you, Mr. Woodie!
Mr. Woodie, are you alright?
Can you make a toy without meat in it?
Mum used to handle all of our sewing.
Strap some rabbits to our head, good idea.
This might keep the sun out of our eyes.
We'll blend in perfectly.
A fortress for my face.
Feathers enough to cover our spiderness.
Mum always said I should take a cap with me.
Like father used to wear.
It itches and fits funny.
It's so puffy!
It'll keep us from catching a cold.
Spider in the bushes.
Colorful crown.
One more point of contact won't slow us down.
Hat of a cat.
This is the best idea we have ever had.
This should keep us cool.
We might look silly, but it'll keep our fur dry.
It'll keep the water out of our fur.
Safety first!
Grandpa's style, definitely.
Disturbing, but it'll keep us dry.
We'll be the hairiest spider ever.
It feels smart and squishy on our head.
Does snakeskin make us look tough?
Rain will bead off our reptilian coat.
A boy inside a spider inside a whale.
Wind can't hold us back!
Oh, oh yuck! We'll never get that out of our fur!
We are protected from sick smells...
We feel light on our feet.
A smile to wear on our forehead!
One for each of us!
Now we won't cough so much.
A safari hat!
Check out our hat!
I bet we can fool those pigs with this!
Strap some rabbits to your head, good idea.
Keeps the sun out of all eight of your eyes.
The wearer will blend in perfectly.
It's a face fortress!
It looks like it took a whole flock to make that hat!
You're always supposed to wear a jacket!
For looking bushier!
This is the best idea anyone's ever had.
Dry fur is the best fur.
It'll keep the water out of your fur.
We wish it had eight lenses.
It covers our biggest eyes, anyway.
It's a cap cap!
Why did we make this?
Hopefully they don't notice the extra legs.
Fancy rocks!
Wow, these are really heavy.
Looks sturdy.
Everything's dandy.
Something's brewing.
It's getting magickier!
Stable, for now.
Magic go down the hole.
Return to us, day!
Not much magic here.
Many legs make light work, and so does this.
Nice and glowy.
Time to build!
Even with all our legs, a little teleportation is nice.
We summon you, warm ball of light!
Magic taker-apart-er.
Double duty.
And now we are king.
Nice and lightweight.
We will, we will, smash you!
Wakey wakey!
Stop looking at me!
Teleportation gives us a chance to rest all our feet.
This does not look swift.
Do we think this is sturdy enough?
How's that old song go?
Ah we can stretch all our legs...
It provides peace of mind at sea.
Ready to set sail!
Never leave home without one.
This'll give us a push!
Now we can harness the wind!
With our sheet of gross skins, we're ready for adventure.
A feathery sail makes for swift travel.
Who needs a sail!
With this we can make a warship!
Everyone get out of our way!!
Things swim in. Dinner comes out.
It won't work again until we fuel it.
It's making the boats feel better!
We gotta fill it up soon.
It's off right now.
It's running real good!
It's running out of juice.
I wonder what we'll drag up.
What a tangled web we weave!
It's going down. Slowly.
It's going down!
I can see so far!
We can see better than all our eyes!
Just like a real boatguy!
Aaargh, we feel so salty!
Yarr! Haha.
It pays to be safe.
I don't know. Looks kinda flimsy.
It cooks with every cut!
We'll be unstoppable!
One jab make 'em burn up!
Our enemies will feel the heat!
The weather will be bomb-y!
A gentle ocean breeze waits within this shell. Well, maybe not so gentle.
It's a stick!
The volcano does our bidding!
Neat! We can disarm traps with this.
A tiny hammer, like in my dinosaur digging kit.
Hey, now we can be prospectors.
Gee. We can see all kinds of things now.
I miss street lamps.
They don't turn off when I get close!
That looks like a pig house

There's nothing on it.
You look like grandpa's cat!
We're best friends.
Father taught me how to take care of goats!
She's a monster just like me!
He gives the fuzziest hugs.
Gobble gobble!
A spider and an insect, what a pair!
Boy, I wish we could eat it.
Bubbles!
Pawns are just as important as the rest of the pieces.
Where's the king of the castle?
We could sculpt a stallion batalion!
We've never seen toys so big.
It's... alive?!
We're sure she's nicer than she looks.
Reminds me of grandpa.
This is a really good sculpture.
The fur looks so real!
She doesn't look so mean.
We can practically feel the fire!
It looks kinda yummy, doesn't it?
Anchors away!
Almost as pretty as the real thing.
It looks kinda like an alien.
We should build this.
We think it cuts better than a regular axe.
It's sharp enough to split a spider hair.
I miss bubble baths.
That's for building a boat.
More legs means faster rowing!
Rowing is kinda fun!
It makes the boat feel better.
That's for making an anchor.
That's for building a mast.

Steering Wheel KitSteering Wheel Kit- 
That's for making a steering wheel.
I'm not a good reader, but he is!
This one has pictures!
Why should we read about flowers when we can pick them?
It's... beddy-bye time...
We don't like how this one ends!
Why are the pages all slimy?
It's sticky, like a web.
We feel safer already!
How come it's not on?
Oh, oh!
Oh no! It got burnt!
She made us a nightlight!
It feeds hungry machines.
We think it's running low.
Hey Winona! How do we fix it?
Machines think gem power is really tasty.
Winoooona! The thing broke!
We're ready to let spikes fly!
It's a very pointy planty trap!
Double doodoo.
Our breath will smell stinky. Yay!
It turns everything into dessert!
Ho! Ha! That's spicy!
Mmm, salty!
Treats, treats, treats!
Oh, Wendy! We'll trade you for your choco pigs!
Haha ew! It's weird!
We forgot what good things tasted like!
Mmm! Sweet revenge!
Candy candy candy!
We aren't totally comfortable with this.
Gummy worms, yummy worms!
Haha, that's not candy!
Oh, Ms. Wicker! We saved these for you!
No worse than the other stuff we've eaten out here!
Wriggly, yet satisfying.
We like these a lot.
Gosh, it's spicy.
Maybe we should hide this before someone gets hurt.
It's not bouncy. What's the point?
I kinda wanna drink what's left, but he won't let me.
We've already got some, thanks.
The monkey probably needed that.
It's a friend for our finger!!
Haha! Everything looks so small!
That's boring.
Haha, it looks like a snail shell.
Haha! Weird!
Neat!!
C'mon little croc! Let's adventure!
The plant is so pretty!
It doesn't get any good channels.
What's it for?
Wow. Look at it bubble.
Makes us feel big and strong!
It's pretty powerful.
It's only a little powerful.
Neat! It's like firecrackers.

Totally Normal RootTotally Normal Root- 
We should plant this somewhere.
It's a monster kid. Like me!
Gosh. That almost looks real.
If we put it in a tree it'd look almost real.
We should put this guy in a tree!
Oooh. Spooky. We should decorate!
Aw. It's not real. Let's hang it somewhere.
Let's hang it somewhere for Halloween!
Are we seeing things?!
Hey, those trees aren't so scary anymore!
I want to give someone something nice!
Oh! What is it?!
It's just a boring planter without a tree.
Aw... Why...
It still needs to grow some more.
Winter's Feast! It's Winter's Feast!
Nooo! The tree!
I won't eat it. It's our friend now.
Yuck! What is that??
Icy icy icing!
Eat twenty candy canes! There's no candy shame!
Haha, Wendy! Watch our Woodie impression!
Where are the plums?
Apple juice?! Yes!!
It makes our claws and tummy so warm.
It's really, really good!
Can we get a boost? We can't reach the treetop.
We want to keep one for ourselves.
Wow, that one looks great!
Not so scary when they're like this.
Huh. It kinda looks...goaty!
We wanna give it something!
The pot's empty.
The fire destroyed it.
We're so lucky!
So shiny!
Don't worry Ms. Wicker, we'll be careful.
Our own personal night light!
It's so big!!
The front part's sort of scary.
I'm not sure I want to be in *another* belly.
We like the tail!
It wants to give us presents!
Let's put the torch in!
Our head buzzes when we blow it.
Sit! Stay?
It looks like a big puppy.
N-nice puppy!
It's got no eyes. Creepy!
We need somewhere to make it!
Puppy!
That's a big, bad dog.
We can make some fun stuff now!
We should find some meat for it.
Aww... that's too bad.
Yummy!
Mmmmmm.
Smells good.
Neat! The Pig King would like that.
Leave us alone!
Yikes! He's angry.
Wish he wouldn't hit us so much.
Cool tattoos!
It's too close to bedtime to start another game.
We need to clean up before we can play.
Lets wait until the danger passes before we play.
We'll leave this sign for someone else.
Maybe he's nice?
Leave us alone!
Don't bite us!
That turtle's huge!
Wouldn't you rather be bug friends with us?
No monkey business, mister!
You don't look so tough!
Looks like a big bully!
All that armor must be heavy.
This isn't home!
Time to go... 
It doesn't have its key.
That looks much better!
That's the bad guy portal!
Hey, help me break this Battle Standard!
We'll protect each other, spider babies!
Hey hi, rock-person!
That uses magic to hurt people.
It hurts people with magic.
We can read the words but we can't make them work.
Are those even words in there?
We're not strong enough to use it.
Wigfrid makes it look so cool!
I don't really want it.
You look different, Lucy. Did you get a haircut?
That sword is too big for us to carry!
We like fighting from far away.
Those look like fun!
It's like fiery spit balls.
Uhh, I don't think that's very safe.
We'd skitter really fast with that.
Safety first!
We like this armor a lot.
This armor seems pretty good!
We'll be an impervious spider!
Maybe we should let someone tougher have it.
We should armor up to be safe.
That looks like it was made for spiders.
We like that hat!
That helmet is really something!
That might make us scuttle faster.
It sure is sparkly.
It looks neat, but we don't want it.
I don't think we should wear that.
It makes your day a little brighter.
It makes you feel a little better when you wear it.
Hold on, we'll help!
There you go!
All better!
We don't want to use that.
Does your kid want to play?
Hi! I'm Webber!
Hi there! Wanna trade?
Hey. You look nice.
Hi, Mr. Pig!
It's sleeping.
They're not afraid of us!!
Take it easy, grandpa.
I should leave it alone.
It's not moving.
Don't be afraid!
Aww... all the berries are gone now.
Maybe we could make a salad.
Those mushrooms are tiny.
No more little mushrooms.
That one got a bit squishy.
It's gonna take too long to grow back.
What a cool purple shrub.
All the good stuff's gone.
I wonder why the people left this nice place.
Why would anyone do that?
There isn't any sap yet.
Sticky, sticky sap!
Ew... The bugs got in it.
Aw, now it's not as pink.
Ivy grows everywhere.
I think it's hungry.
We hope it's good.
At least it took us somewhere different.
It looks like the friendly goat we met.
A lotta goat statues around here.
I wish we could ride in that.
We can't even fix it.
Bummer.
Aw. That's too bad.
I don't think that clock works anymore.
It doesn't lead anywhere anymore.
Too bad.
I think it's sort of pretty.
It almost looks real.
I've never seen their houses up close!
No one lives in it anymore.
It looks sharp.
It's locked. I think we need a key.
Park. Park. Park!
We want to do the grinding!
No coins in it. I guess no one made wishes.
It's nice enough.
Wow. She looks beautiful.
It doesn't look very cozy.
Well, it wouldn't hurt to take a look.
Someone's precious things are probably inside.
Do they have any toys?
That's full of good stuff.
It's all crusty around the edges.
It's a monument or something.
It's the kind of lamp they have in the city.
We're almost as tall as this lamp.
Does it still tell the right time?
Aw. Someone died.
Aww... It's broken.
We should put it together.
We can hang a pot off this.
We gotta set this up.
Mom said I should be careful around the oven.
Let's find a place to put it.
What should we cook?
We could use it to make yummy food.
We have to be careful when we cook.
You cook stuff in it.
This pot's a bit bigger than the other one.
It's kinda small.
We can cooks stuff in it.
Sweet pot!
We should set it up at the crusty pond.
We have to wait for more salt.
Salt's ready.
We can trap little crabs in this.
I know how to use this!
I don't wanna use this.
It's a big ol'bucket.
Cool! I wonder what it unlocks?
We wanna go to the park.
I wonder where this takes us.
We can plant a whole bunch of food with this.
We can find out what they are by planting them.
Mom said fish oil is good for our brain.
Smells good!
Crabs kinda look like spiders.
We don't want to eat it.
This probably doesn't count as a salad, huh.
I don't like mushrooms.

GarlicGarlic- 
Maxwell says you ward monsters away with it.
It didn't ward us off!
It makes all our eyes water!
Our eyes don't water any more.
Woah! A potato!
It's a cooked potato now.
Is it a fruit or a vegetable?
It's a cooked fregetable. Vruit?
Wow! It's a turnip!
We cooked the turnip.
If only I were back at the mill.
It's no good by itself.
Milk is good for our bones. Endo and exo!
We're gonna crunch them all up.
We don't use a lot of salt on our food.
Sticky, gooey sap.
Aw... It's no good anymore.
Sweet!
It doesn't taste very good on its own.
We ground it all up.
We could trade it for something small.
I wonder what we can buy with this.
We can buy a whole bunch of stuff with this.
The nice lady said we need three of them.
We can put it on the altar now.
We think the Gnaw wants something different.
The goat lady said this was what the Gnaw wanted.
This is what it wants, but it's kinda puny.
It's okay. The next one will be better.
Now we don't have to eat off the floor.
Now we don't have somewhere to put food.
Aww. We want in there.
We already put this on a dish.
Hmmm... I think we need a different dish for this.
It's still working on the first one.
I don't think we should offer that.
Aw... It's the wrong one.
Oops. Someone else is using that.
Oh no! That wasn't a recipe!
Oh no! We burnt it!
Don't eat us!
I'm ready to go home now!
Pines are always greener on the other side of the fence.
A dying breed.
A harsh tree for harsh conditions.
Got you good, tree!
An axe can solve any tree-related problem!
What a senseless waste of firewood.
It's extra dangerous now!
Only we can prevent forest fires.
Its growing days are over.
Grow, grow!
That's a log of wood.
So much for our arts and crafts!
Hard and black, like my better half.
It's bursting with life.
I hope it doesn't fall on us.
Hello, Mr. Tree!

Living LogLiving Log- 
This log has a face.
These sure grow slowly.
We'll make good use of your twigs!
So bright!
Into the ground with you!
Wish we had a friend to play stick swords with.
Grass, next best thing to silk.
Picked down to the stems.
It could use some perking up.
Fire fire fire!
We should be able to weave this, too.
Ripe for the pickin'.
See you soon, berries!
It's run out of plant food.
Maybe we could use some of those.
Only stems remain.
Those burn quickly!
Reeds, web, what's the difference.
What will blossom?
Is it done yet?
We're master farmers.
That's a thirsty plant.
Hope we don't fall on that.
That hurt our hands.
It will be gone soon!
We agree that flowers are nice.
How colorful.
This flower is decidedly not nice!
They make our head hurt.
Bury your head, carrot.
Ready for the taking!
We can't get at it like this.
I think some spores remain.
Ready for harvest.
We can't get at it!
It's gone now.
Vroom vroom mushroom.
Hiding, are we?
Maybe it will regrow.
My, what nice foliage you have.
Got you good, tree!
What a senseless waste of firewood.
Only we can prevent forest fires.
May you have a long and free life.
I think the heat broke it.
The heat wave bested it.
Heat too intense for ya?
It's all dried out and dead.
Tree or food, there's something inside.
It's got more things coming out of it than we do.
It's got no meat left in it.
Who knows what that tumbleweed has picked up.
Cute little bamboo.
Not a bad tree.
It's a nice bush.
It has a bamboo-boo.
We cut it up!
We took it all.
Too hot!
It's bamburnt.
It's not green anymore.
All burned up.
We're a gardening expert!
Where should we put this?
Grow, grow, grow!
Hard to believe such a big tree comes from this!
Such a useful stick-type thing.
This stuff is wild.
It's going for a swim.
I want to poke it, but I'm afraid our hand will get stuck.
We should weed that out, maybe.
It would be a cool place for a treehouse.
So no treehouse, then.
This tree has presents!
What a senseless waste of firewood.
It's dropped its last coconut.
Goodbye, Tree of Palms.
Aw. It's so little.
Big leaf.
Nothing out of the ordinary here.
It looks like a weed.
Neat!

Oh wow. Aloe's good for lots of stuff.
We should pick those.
Hey little guy.
Whew-ee. That plant really clears our sinuses.
Those will grow back probably.
We should give it some better dirt.
It sure likes being watered!
We should plant this somewhere.
Watch out for a prickly thorns!
Aw... That's pretty. How do we get it?
Cool! Vines!
It's probably super old.
Wow, it's so pink!

Lily PadLily Pad- 
That's a really big lily pad!
We should be careful not to knock it over.
Nice enough hedge.
It looks shaggy. We should trim it.

Hedge (burnt)- 

Intricate Topiary- 
How fancy!
That's pretty!
What could've moved that over here?
There's no berries on it.
It's a stick.
Can't climb that tree.
Yeesh. What could've broken that?
Would a cool bandage make you feel better, Mr. Tree?
Don't worry lil guy, it'll grow back!
Does anyone want to play stick swords with us??
I bet those would be useful.
We grew it together!
Weird little plant.
All burned up.
We want to climb it!
What a senseless waste of firewood.
Only we can prevent forest fires.
It's too flimsy to climb.
Little tree!
The tree wants to come out and play!
Are you okay, lil sapling?
Are you okay, lil tuft?
Are you okay, lil bush?
Maybe it needs some chicken soup?
Those berries look so juicy!
It's taking a nap.
Uh-oh! Burnies!
It needs some poops!
Into the ground with you!
Aww, are you sad?
You can plant anything in the ground!
That's a weird shape for a bush.
Bright red petals! We love it!
We think it's a cactus.
It got picked.
There's some kelp floating in the water!
We gave it a haircut.
It would be happier if we planted it.
They're fun to climb on.
Chopped all up.
It's getting all burned up!
All burned up.
Easy piece-y.
What a pretty tree!
Sorry, tree.
I hope trees don't feel pain.
It's dead now.
We like this flower!
It'll be a big tree one day.
There's rocks growing out of that bush!
It doesn't have anything good.
We don't think it can make fruit anymore.
Too hot.
It looks a little pale.
It's really sick.
It's burning!
Oh wow, it's growing!
It's a hive of activity.
Sounds like anger!
Honey pods!
This place scares us.
There isn't much left.
Some sort of religious monument maybe?
It's in our way.
Something about this rock feels off.
Move, stupid rock!
I wonder what that does.
Someone took the head.
Nothing lasts forever in this world.
Maybe we should take up sculpting.
Smells fishy.
A waste of food.
We just wanted to be friends.
If only we could get closer.
Impenetrable.
We'll need to mine it before we can use it.
None of these look like they would skip well.
Oh, to feel a sharp edge against my skin.
What are we supposed to do with this?
We definitely like shiny.
Our loot sense is tingling.
We're sorry about that.
A pile of dirt. I bet it's hiding something.
Whatever it is, it travels single file.
It's too muddy to track.
Fresh tracks!
I can hear the sounds of another world!
I don't think we're done yet!
It still won't work!
We could use this to visit new worlds!
I think there are more parts.
A crank that will stand up to punishment.
The power in this box is unimaginable.
It looks like this goes with something....
I think that thing's alive.
I've been in worse.
That was a scary hole!
Water doesn't go well with our fur.
Hello? Are you all right?
Looks cozy in there.
A portable friendship pod!
Come out! We just want to be friends.
Maybe they'll invite us in?
I think someone was here.
It's not much to look at.
Maybe it's time to abandon ship, birdie.
There must be a way to grab it.
Chilling.
Ice can be useful.
Puddle!
It's too muddy to track.
Hidey-hole.
I hope they're okay in there.
It's in worse shape than before!
I wonder who he was.
Gross.
Trunk house.
The nine lives thing is true!
A statue of some weird bug.
Take that, rock bug!
Er, where did the spider parts go?
Hard to believe this thing was ever seaworthy.
The sixlegger lives underground.
Can I come in?
Smells fishy.
It's in worse shape than before!
Fishies for the taking!
That is where the armored meat goes during the day.
A coral party!
Pretty colors.
Aw, hi there.
This rock is covered in food things!
Come back, yumyums.
Beneath that stony exterior lies... stone, probably.
The ground is angry.
Better finish packing.
Wish we had a bucket and a shovel.
We like to feel it beneath our feet.
Maybe some kitties will come out and play?
Bland sand.
Is that a... oh my...
Will it hatch soon?
Which end are those coming from?
It went home...
It's so choppy!
We're on the trail!
The yucky stuff down there might be useful.
Eww! It's stuck in our fur!
Yuck! It's sticky!
It's like a fishbowl... without the bowl!
Blazing hot!
Yuck.
Is it done yet?
I think I'm too young for this.
How unsettling!
Let's look inside!
Where's the rest of the ship?
Wow, a crate.
He doesn't look too happy.
We can hear the ocean with these. We can also hear it without them.
Yikes! The ground is farting!
Boom-material!
Treasure, treasure, treasure!
We like the wild ball man.
Blub blub.
A reminder to respect the sea.
Can we eat off this?
It's weird!
Someone's got a screw loose.
Aw, it's not even edible.
Maybe it's for hulahooping?
What's under here?!

Dung PileDung Pile- 
Oh, poop!
Yuck!
It's one of those scary bird's nests.
Shhh... it's sleeping.

Iron Hulk (hand, inactive)- 
It's a sleepy robot hand.

Iron Hulk RibsIron Hulk (ribs, inactive)- 
Yikes. Looks scary.

Iron Hulk (foot, inactive)- 
That looks like it could stomp us!

Iron OreIron Ore- 
We could make all kinds of neat stuff with this.
It’s full of sparkling stuff.
Wow! I wonder if it's worth anything.
It's where all those little bugs live.
That's where the miner's live.
Hey, there's the treasure!
That's probably where those mean bats live.

Mant HillMant Hill- 
Are we welcome in there?
That’s a good place for some light.
We’ll need to mine it before we can use it.

Fountain of Youth- 
We could stay a kid forever!

Hello? Anyone home?
Nothing lasts forever on its own.
Maybe that was too mean.
I wonder who that was.
It's pretty... pretty scary!
Oh, bother!
Not web. We can’t walk on it.
I wonder what the bees are making!
It's a bit scary, but we don't like to judge.
That looks really nice!
I think it really ties the island together.
It was hiding!
Where's your head, mister?
Peekaboo, monster!
Oh! That piece was his nose.
There! All better!
You look great!
I think it's stuck in there.
Ouch! Burnies!
Wow! A rock!
They're probably fine.
It looks real lifelike, but it's all cold to touch.
Nice sword!
Solid marble!
Neat!
Neat, it's a ball that floats by itself!
Gosh. It's so sparkly!
It's broke.
I wonder what it wants?
Something else needs to happen, right?
Bright sticky stick!
I don't think it wanted that.
Oh... We don't like this!
It's all stone and no bark.

Rock DenRock Den- 
It looks warm in there.
Oh no, %s! %s must have really hurt him!
Oh no, %s! %s must have really hurt her!
Oh no, %s! %s must have really hurt them!
Is there a spider friend rustling beneath?
Definitely not a spider!
Looks like a... cactus? No, that's not right.
Did someone lose this?
I think it's looking at us!
Yikes.
Haha. We can stack things on its head and it won't even move.
Presents?!
That's a pretty lake!
It takes forever to get sand out of our fur.
We'll need to mine it down, I guess.
Gotta get rid of the other boulders first.
What a cute starfish!
Yikes, that thing was hungry!
Now nobody will hurt themselves on it.
Hm? Do you need something from me?
Don't worry, you'll be together again soon.
It can't talk like we do, but it's a friend.
It doesn't want to be here. We don't either.
It wants to go to one of those cracks in the ground.
It's trying to talk, we think!
Don't step on a crack!
Splish splash.
It smells nice and looks pretty.
We could crack it open.
Aw, it's all dried up.
Oh no, someone's trapped inside that rock!
Is the moon green, too?
It came from the moon. Wow!
Yuck! Dead stuff.
We hope no one crashes their boat on that!
I don't want to be friends with those ones.

It makes sure nothing bad happens to us.
It's plugged up.
We'd rather visit our spider friends on the surface.
I can hear some spider friends down there.
We like it down here.
It leads back to the light.
It's upsettingly large.
Bigger than a normal mushroom.
How did it get so big?
Oooh, a glowing ball of flower!
Bright and delicious.
Rocks underground?! Shocking.
Pointy rocks underground?! Simply Stunning.
We could stand to live there.
Slimy and rocky.
Did you hear something?
Swirly plants.
Soft and leafy.
It's a tropical cave tree, of course.

We'll explore when everyone else has had their turn!
They don't have enough space for us!
Oooh they're hiding in there!
Hahah! Wow, it smells so bad!
It's all round and squishy now!
It sounds so funny!
This one looks friendly!
Our favorite color! Red!
If we stare at it we'll turn to stone!
That's green, our favoritest color!
If we lick it we'll turn to wood!
Blue! That's our favorite color!
If we eat it we'll turn to water!
Aww so sad!
What could possibly go wrong?
We want to play archaeologist!
Needs more bones!
Maybe we shouldn't play with bones.
That looks real good!
We put the bones together wrong.
It's not waking up.
It's plugged up.
It's throbbing strangely.
We can repair it.
Old and full of mysteries.
Just a normal pond plant.
A mess of chess.
These haven't been used in a while.
Smashed beyond repair.
Small bits of fancy rock.
It likes it down here.
Stylish storage.
What a big treasure box!
Not exactly my kind of nightlight.
It's been busted up.
We feel cold.
It's judging us.
But those were presents!
It likes us!
We need another piece to turn it on.
What's it doing?
Does that mean we get to go home?
It looks like it's gonna blow up!
It wasn't a way home, anyway.
We never learned those letters.
No light.
We don't like it.
It's a picture of some bug people.
This picture's all messed up.
There's a lot of black goop in this picture.
A picture of bug people escaping their bug outsides!
A picture of a city. It looks like a nice place to live.
They look sick.
We forge the fire items here!
It's covered in the happy beans.
We took them all.
No more mean beans.
The bean bush looks sad.
With just a little love you could grow again.
It's made of hurt!
It's withered, but still hurts to touch.
Are you sleeping in there?
Now I can use it.
This could really hurt someone.
This rock is pretty tough.
Volcano rocks rock!
Big, crumbly rock.
I think it's speaking to me.
Keep your bodily fluids to yourself!
Someone free him!

We can't use it right now.

There's stuff stuck in there.
Whoa! That looks fancy.
Wow. It must be pretty valuable.
It's really, really heavy.
Oh no, someone had an accident!
Quick, plug it up!
Wow, it's MASTive!
It's the least fun diving board.
Oh, oh, we want to steer!
If we put these on the ground we'll have a floor!
Carpets! Just like in our old house.
Fancy.
Some grassy dirt.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some pretty average earth.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some ground we dug up.
Some ground we dug up.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some ground that we dug up.
Some road that we dug up.
Our feet go click-clack on this.
Soft like our body.
Some pretty average earth.
Warm and cozy ground!
Some ground that we dug up.
Wow! That's a complicated clockwork.
You don't play by the chess rules that grandpa taught.
Who made these things!?
Goodnight, good knight.
Bishop of bad dreams.
You can't rook us.
Is somebody there?!
Aah! Monsters in the dark!
That's an angry puppy!
He's got a fire under his feet. And all inside him.
He has a chilling look in his eyes.
Our very own tooth to gnash.
Spiders understand us.
Can you teach us to fight good?
Aww! I think it's having a dream.
Night-night.
Another lost friend.
Forgive us.
This might sooth our cuts.
It's so smooth!
Give us back our things!
We could put more in it but we're scared to touch the stuff he left inside.
I would've thought they would bathe more often!
Ack! Sticky tongue!
Oblivious amphibious.
A hop too far.
We would be mad if something stepped on us, too.
We could hit stuff with the pointy bits!
Spotty!
It's huge!
Oooh let's jump in!
Aw, it's just a baby!
We wouldn't want to cross that one.
He's all furry now!
That's not a fun ghost!
I don't think he wants to be friends with us.
He has anger in his eyes.
Maybe we can use it for arts and crafts.
Reminds me of grandpa.
Shoo!
We have you in our web.
Maybe we can put the blood back in?
Suck someone else's blood!
Friends!
Lay down some web for us.
Screechy mean guy!
What a colorful plant.
I wish we could learn to generate meat.
Ever vigilant.
Hairy tongue thing!
It's like a tiny rug.
Our friends live up there.
Creepy crawly!
What could possibly go wrong?
Some dirt, big whoop.
Maybe it just needs a cuddle!
Scratchy, like father's beard!
I don't think that puppy is very happy.
What're you so mad about?
Got you good, tree!
So that's what's inside!
Ohh, oh no, uh, fetch??
Leave us alone!
Don't mind us, Mr. Dog!
It's mean!
Why is it so aggressive!
I can't imagine this would hurt very much.
As if normal pirates weren't scary enough!
These ones leave a gift when they bite.
The backside of a mosquito.
We should keep our distance from these ones.
These ones have a sick bite!
The skin of a snake!
Can you teach us to fight good?
Night-night.
Forgive us.
Sh...Sh...SHARK!!!!!
Aren't you cute! Hey, what's that smell...
We like your sword face, fish!
His eyes burn with hatred!
This is a very big dead thing.
It's a trailblazer!
That's a little creepy.

Gnat SwarmGnat Swarm- 
Don't bite us, little guys.
Cool! Vines!
We should be friends!
He looks sneaky.
This would be great for hide and seek.
I can find all that bad guy's treasures.
Wow! You're really colorful.
That guy's got a lot of energy!
Hello, fellow arachnid.
I think it wants to eat us!
We aren't food!
You're not a friend!
We shouldn't get too close.
It wasn't a fellow spider anyway. Not really.
Nice monster!
We should be very quiet so he doesn't wake up.
Phew. I think we're safe.
Huh. It's pig hide but it came from a bat.
Agh! Stay away!
Those bugs are annoying.
It's a bunch of shells from those bugs.
It's the perfect tooth to gnash.
Forgive us, brother.
I won't think about where it came from.
They look angry.
We should just squish you.
Don't hurt us and we won't hurt you!
So fluffy but so mean!!
Sizzling hot!
Poor puppy.
I miss the puppy, but I don't want it to come back.
Make it stop, make it stop!
Woah! How'd you get rid of your outside skin?
Night night, gross puppy.
It's dead!
It's even more monstrous than us!
We don't want to get closer.
It's dead!
These friends look... weird.
Night-night, scary friend.
Sorry!
Big big beefalo!
He seems to want to stick around.
Slumber deep, beefalo.
Shaved you good!
This one likes us!
We like to cuddle this one!
This one looks fast.
We're kind of scared of this one.
Thick fur.
If this makes the mating call we're in trouble.
Get busy, child.
That's the opposite of busy.
Flying ouchies!
Always Be Pollinating.
Uh oh, run!
Ours now!
I hope it doesn't escape.
We should be careful, we could poke an eye out!
Aw, you're no fun.
I never knew we could be friends!
He won't bully us any more.
Take that!
Hop along, bunny.
We feel lucky, oh so lucky.
Maybe it's lost.
We finally found it!
Where do they live the rest of the year?
Snip snap!
We'll slaughter that slurtle.
We'll snuff out that snurtle.
Slime-time!
We hit it a little too hard.
A solid helmet.
We're a giant spider! Wearing a shell!
He just wants to learn!
You won't find any carrion here. We're stuck like this.
A bit more feral than grandpa's cat.
I always liked pulling Whiskers' tail.
My father kept goats.
It's all glowy.
This might make a good weapon.
Hoist the sails, matey!
Buck up, big fella!
Its suffering is over now.
Playful rubber blobs. We'll watch from afar.
Probably as close as I can get to these guys.
The sea is full of such weird junk.
That blob is alive!
Cool horns.
We could put these on something to make it sharp.
My best frenemy.
I don't think he's friendly.
Hey there, noisy guy.
Hello, big guy!
Whoa! Look at how big this is!!
We should be friends!
It must have been really tired.
Gee, that's too bad.
Haha! He looks funny!
Watch it! It's sharp.
Hey little guy! Wanna be our friend?
You're doing a great job, Mr. Guard.
Hop along, lil' bunny.
Let's snuff out that snurtle.
Maybe that was a little too rough.
It didn't protect the last guy.
It smells like yummy fruit.
It looks kinda yummy.
Night night!
Look at it, flitting around happily.
Not so happy now, are we?
Oh, you look like you're having a grand time, flying about.
We all want a bit of freedom.
Red is my favorite color!
Held snug in our pockets.
What pretty white feathers.
We will name it Francis.
Feather of black.
Feather of red.
Feather of white.
Come back! I just want to eat you!
Peekaboo.
We spy a tired eye.
The eyebone didn't survive the trip.
Your insides are gross.
We just want to play!
He's ours now.
Elusive little buggies.
Going on an adventure, got some fireflies in our pocket!
That's a funny looking plant.
You're a bad friend!
The skin is all seared.
Cooked to death.
Ugh, my head!
Nice eyes.
It doesn't smell very nice.
I spoke too soon. It smells worse now.
Funk to funky.
I wish I'd at least ended up with wings. Sigh.
Yucky muck!
Come out and play!
Hello little guy!
Hello little guy.
Wooow! Pretty water lights!
One, two... s-six legs. Aw, we thought maybe you were a friend.
Come out, come out, wherever you are!
Say, there's a lot of meat on you!
Here kitty, kitty!
We wonder what this is?
Funk to funky.
Hello our large-mouthed friend!
You look really nice!
What do you think it eats?
Aren't you a chatty fellow!
As far as birds go, this one's very fashionable.
We want to throw something at you.
It must be nice to fly...and eat garbage.
What a colorful beak you have!
That's a big bird!
Nothing behind the eyes...
The lil dummies come from these.
Hmmm, it dropped this.
Where dumb life begins.
It cracked under the pressure.
To make an omelette you have to endanger a few species.
Aww, it's a lil dummy.

Gee, that's too bad.
Remarkable bird!
He's resting.
Rest in peace.
That's a nice bird.
It needed a rest.
Poor thing.
Is that... poop?
She fell off her poop ball.
She dozed off.
Awww.
Nice little buggy bug.
I think he eats gold.
You've got more eyes than we do!
Neat. A weird bush!

That bird's kinda scary.
Wowee. This is a cool feather.
Let's name it 'Francis'.
Haha. You make all our stuff slobbery.
The meeping had to stop.
Ow, our head!
Hey! You dropped something!
He's our new friend.
He was our new friend.
Give us a Huggy!
That's a yellow bird.
Caught you!
Uh, are you feeling okay?
Feather of yellow.
It's my friend.
Happy lavae!
Poor hungry lavae.
It looks starving!
Maybe I can make it hatch?
The egg seems happy.
Poor egg. It looks cold.
What a weird tooth.
Being all frozen up probably isn't comfy.
It looks soft.
Did you change your hair, deer? Looks good!
Haha, weird.
It looks like a nice bird.
I got you now.
Nighty night.
Hey, little friend!
We'll keep you safe.
Night night.
Oh no!
What a pretty moth!
Don't worry, we won't eat you.
Look at those legs!
That egg could feed us for days!
Where's the egg?
Did I hear a meep?
Smells great!
I think it's hatching!
What if it hatches in our belly?
It'll boil if it doesn't cool down soon.
It's shivering!
Looks like an egg.
Did that egg just move?
Could this be a friend for us?
I can see its tummy rumble.
Poor thing. It looks so hungry!
It's getting old so fast!
It looks hungry!
I think it's starving!
Bad bird!
This could feed us for days!
Where did that come from?

Spider QueenSpider Queen- 
Mommy-Longlegs?
What have I done?

Yucktastic.
Wear that frown upside down.
It's quite tender.
Run for the hills!
It's so thick!
She doesn't look all pleased to see us.
That would make a huge breakfast!
Hungry little guys.
Tickle torture.
Oh don't you just drag on.
They don't weigh much for scales.
Too hot for us!
Looks safe now.
Mean tree!
Run away!
Leave me alone!
Let's open it!
Can it still eat me?
Nature hates us!

SealSealnado (seal form)- 
Its cheeks look so pinchable!
What a curious object.
We can feel the strength coursing through it!
Out of the water!
What're you looking at?
A big fish's breathing bits.
Agh! I think we made him angry!
These are kinda sharp bones.
We could probably make something out of these bones.
Kinda creepy.
Yeesh. She's mad about something.
Haha! We're the king!
He looks scary.
Wow. There's alot of space in there!
Whoa! It's a big robot!
We could make something cool with this.
Very upsetting...
For its babies' sleepytime.
Bees aren't our friends!
We could be part bee now too!
That meanie imprisoned those deer!
Its belly looks hungry!
I think maybe this goes somewhere.
Purple! It's purple!
Do you think we'd fit?
I think it needs help getting out.
Yikes! That's a big frog!
Toadally terrifying!
I think it's doing something bad!
Explodey fungus!
Haha! Yuck!
I don't think it's friendly.
Hey! Meanie!
We can't hit it.
Creepy!
Rattle rattle.
It's not very comfy.
It gets really hot.
Aw, there goes our lure.
That jerk tricked us.
King of the bullies!
Hello? Can you hear me?
That's no party poltergeist!
AAAAAAAAAAH!
He will make a nice friend.
It looks friendly.
Hey there!
Yeesh! Look out!
Woah. That's a big chicken leg!
Keep away from us, please!
Ah! I'm a monster! Haha, we're just kidding.
You're fuzzy. We like that.
It's always nice to have more bug friends.
I think it's upset.
We didn't know rocks could smell.
I think it's ready!
Ouchie!
Not like this!!
Careful, it's fragile.
We think it's great and we love it.
They want to talk, but they don't know how!
Hi %s! Nice weather we're having!
Why are you being so mean, %s?
Meanie! We will stop you no matter what!
%s doesn't believe in ghosts, but he believes in us!
You're looking much paler than usual, %s!
Uh... Is your hair smoking, %s?
Hi %s! How's Bernie?
%s's playing with fire. Err...
You're gonna get burned, %s!
%s's like a burnt marshmallow. Crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside!
Uh-oh! Does that hurt, %s?
Another fire? Well, as long as you're happy...
Hi %s! Have you been working out?
Hey %s, you look upset about something.
You're just a big bully!
%s's nice! I wish he'd stop messing up our head fur, though.
I'm sure you're the strongest ghost, %s. Let's find you a heart, though.
%s, no!! Fire can hurt you!
Hi %s! Let's play, okay?
Are you angry at me, %s?
We're taking my friendship bracelet back!
%s always plays nice with ghosts.
Don't worry, %s! Our spider friends will help bring you back!
Uhh, uh-oh, let's play a different game, %s.
Hi %s! You look very non-organic today!
We thought you were a friendly robot, %s!
Let us introduce you to our world wide web! Sh-sha!
Aww. We'd beep-boop %s on the nose if they had one!
Bad day destroying humans, %s? Tomorrow will be better!
Maybe they didn't know fire is dangerous to us.
Hello Ms. %s!
Uh-oh! We're in trouble with Ms. %s!
Killer! Does this mean we don't have to do our homework?!
Ms. %s is very smart and wise. She's neat!
Don't worry Ms. %s, we'll find you a heart!
Ms. %s! We already had our combustion lessons!
Hi %s, hi Lucy!
%s looks angry today.
You need to treat people nicer, %s!
%s is gruff, but nice.
Wanna go heart-hunting with us, %s?
%s's being gnawghty.
Can I pet your ears or will our claws swish through?
Woah! Would you give us a ride on your back, %s?
I wonder if we'll be able to find a heart big enough for you?
Are you here to tell us nursery rhymes?
Don't worry, we'll get you back to normal! Er, normal-ish.
Um. I think you lit a fire, %s.
Hey! Hi %s!
Maybe we can talk this out?
You're supposed to play nice!
%s is super nice. And his makeup's cool!
We'll help you get back on your feet, %s!
You were just supposed to mime lighting it!
Hi %s! Lookin' dapper!
%s looks eviller than usual...
You're the real monster, %s!
Wow, %s is really nice! He's helping people!
Aw %s, no one deserves to be stuck like that!
Don't burn our things please. We like them.
Wow, %s! You're lookin' tough!
%s looks really mean. And tough.
We're not scared of pointy spearsticks! Fight!

Wow! Even as a ghost you're super tough, %s!
You're supposed to put fires out when you're finished.
A spiderfriend! Hi %s!
Ah! We look scary when we're mad!
We won't let you hurt our friends!
%s likes helping ghosts, just like us.
Oh no! We should help ourselves!
Spiderfriend, why did you light that fire?
Hi %s! Build anything neat today?
Don't do hits, %s!
Murderer! We didn't wanna have to do this!
%s keeps us all together.
Aw, I'm sorry that happened to you, %s.
Don't light fires, %s!
Hey %s! Your horns look nice!
Hey, play nice, %s!
Oh no! %s, what did you do!
Grandpa always said laughter was the best medicine!
Oh no, %s! You're hurt!
Don't play tricks, Mr. Imp!
Hey, it's my good friend, %s!
Hey, %s! Friends don't hit friends!
Wickerbottom says we can't be friends anymore!
%s is really rooting for us!
Poor %s! He died of loneliness!
I don't think it's safe for you to be around fire.
Hey %s! Do you have any snacks?
%s, don't you think you should say sorry?
We thought you were nice!
Thanks a bunch, %s!
Oh no, %s is hurt!
We don't think you were supposed to start that fire.
Hey %s! Whatcha up to?
Hey, stop it! No hitting!
Why would you do that, %s?
Whew, thanks %s!
Don't worry! I'm sure there's a heart around here somewhere!
I... don't think that's allowed...
Hey! Hi %s!
%s looks mean.
Meanie! Get'em!
%s is super nice to ghosts.
Don't worry %s, we'll find you a heart!
%s, you lit a fire!
A hard shelled egg.
Fried just like mum did.
Some fire would spice this up.
Can't have any pudding if we don't eat it.
That worked better than expected.
A couple more and we'll have a meal!
Meat treat.
It'll keep longer this way.
Smells foul.
It'll go down, but I won't be happy about it.
It's really chewy.
It's all squishy.
It smells kind of rotten.
I just want to bang on my drum.
We love finger food.
It could stand to be fried.
Flaky and moist. Delicious.
Fresh water-snake.
We could slurp this down.
We took his nose!
He blue his nose.
Looks filling!
A fraction of a frog.
I admit, I've acquired a taste for these.
This thing drives me batty.
Tastes like chicken.
All dogfish go to heaven, right?
Should we eat it or use it?
It's pretty!
It is neither jelly nor fish. It is also no longer alive.
We hoped it would be more... solid.
Sorry, fishy.
I love brightly colored food!
We'll try anything once.
It would probably be better cooked.
We left our can opener at home.
Flaky and moist. Delicious.
It's a little fishy.
Boney.
Do we have to eat these?
Taste like ocean.
Maybe one day I'll have big mussels.
Still kind of gross.
These aren't spider eggs.
Not the kind of eggs we're used to.
You're so slimy!
Mmm, smells good!
It's slippery!
It's not as cute anymore.
Haha! What a silly face.
He likes the fish heads. I don't.
Do we touch it?
It's not moving anymore...
Yum yum yum!
It's a big goopy mess.
It's strangely hot.
I'm not sure these are edible like this.
I wonder if all the poison is out of them now.
Slimy little guy.
Not sure we should eat these.
A couple more'll make a morsel meal!
I don't know what everyone's complaining about.
I admit, we've acquired a taste for those.
It's so little!
Aww, just a little guy.
It's kind of cute. Too bad we're gonna eat it.
We know we can catch a bigger fish!
Woah, this fish is weird!
Eww, it'd covered in mud!
You'd be pretty tasty with some chips.
Yikes, this one's all prickly!
This one was really tough to catch.
Does this count as eating our vegetables?
Juice sacks.
Warm juice sacks.
A bundle of bananas.
Hot mush.
It looks suspect.
It looks tastier now.
Pungent.
No sir, I don't like it.
I didn't expect this to grow.
It's good for us!
Looks tasty!
We can cook anything!
A bundle of bananas.
Hot mush.
Food! From a tree!
Now there's one for each of us.
Just needs a tiny umbrella.
These smell... adult.
These make me feel funny.
Anything can be cooked!
Yum! Let's find more!
They're so filling!
I sort of miss being forced to eat these.
Easier for us both.
Corn in the raw.
Popping corn.
Blech, eggplant.
Mum knew I liked it braised.
That's a huge pumpkin!
It's all warm now.
It smells funny.
It smells better now.
Smells really earthy.
Heat really brings out the juices.
You'd have to be crazy...
Good thing we're feeling healthy.
It's gushing with light.
I like me a lichen.
Haven't had enough, huh?
Take that, pokey things!
This part is nice.
Salad of the sea...
Very salty.
It sticks to the roof of our mouth!
We want to eat that!
You say po-tat-o, I say dinner!
Orange foodmush.
I bet this is good for us.
We cooked it!
Mom said we should eat our vegetables.
Asparagus makes our pee smell funny.
These guys look neat!
Sorry little guys.
Gosh, this sure is beautiful.

NettleNettle- 
These nettles smell really strong.
These are kinda spicy.
This will make us grow up big and strong.
I don't think it's ripe yet.
Yummy.
Does this look ripe to you?
Remember French Fries?
I dare you to eat it!
Slimy, yet satisfying.
He doesn't like it very much, but I think it's okay.
Mmm, salty and flaky!
We have to wait for it to ripen.
We cracked it open.
No more pit!
Maxwell says you ward monsters away with it.
It didn't ward us off!
It makes all our eyes water!
Our eyes don't water any more.
It's so small and cute!
I bet it's spicy.
Woah! A potato!
It's a cooked potato now.
Is it a fruit or a vegetable?
It's a cooked fregetable. Vruit?
Who knew we could cook!
Do you know the muffin spider?
We baked it!
At least we know how to make fish sticks.
Taco Tuesday!
Ew... sticky fingies.
Sandwich for me, frog legs for him.
Pile o' fruit.
Ooo, tasty!
We wish they were shaped like dinosaurs.
Foods on a stick!
We fall asleep in the bath too!
I used to make these with grandpa!
Smells like Sunday supper.
Mmm!
It does not look like pie...
Mum never let me have these.
Yum!
Do we have to eat our veggies?
We will stuff ourself with eggyplants!
Candy!
Like mother used to make before this happened!
It was easy to make with all our arms.
Yummy!
Experimenting is fun!
We are accomplished chefs!
Holy moley, this is tasty.
We dream of ice cream.
Just the thing for a hot summer day.
Flavor bombs!
Crunchy and healthy.
Yaaay! Popsicle, popsicle!
We lift our pinkies when we eat it.
Hmm, something smells fishy about this!
Yucky!
Bitter...
Yummy!
We want to pour it all over our tongues!
We have to eat it with our eyes closed. Too many legs!
We could eat it forever!
Yum, yum, soup!
Eww, healthy!
Cripes! We can't wait for these crepes!
Looks amazing!
About as appetizing as they get.
It's so dainty.
So fancy!
Mmm! Tastes like food!
Mmmm... warms our tummy.
Yummy!
Hehe. It makes our tummy jiggle.
Yummy and crunchy!
Delicious!
Kinda spicy.
Kinda tastes like chicken noodle.
It's a drink with vegetables in it.
These are just hamburgers.
Let's have a tea party!
I'd rather have sugary cereal. Oh well.
Oh! Sweet and tasty!!
One of my favorite foods! Just me though.
Like mother used to make, in the before time!
Five servings a day.
Will they grow into candy beanstalks?
Warly makes really good stuff.
Okay, we'll eat a salad.
Thanks Warly!
I don't wanna eat it, but Warly was nice to make it for us.
Mmm, mousse!
Just like grandma used to make!
We love when Warly cooks for us.
It's scary, but tasty.
We're so stuffed we'll pop!
It looks so fancy.
Woah! It's cool, AND edible!
Yummy but... spicy!!
WOW! Gelatin!
A small life trapped within. My sympathies.
We could grow something with these...
Their growing days are over.
Sticky and sweet.
Pick our teeth with butterfly bones.
Butter is better.
Blech!
Ew!
It's a boogie!
Roasted on an open fire.
A glass of milk with every supper.
If we eat these will they grow inside us?
Fat and happy.
Yummy headmeats!
We could plant these to grow more sweet potatoes.
Mom says to always clean up after yourself.

Flytrap StalkFlytrap Stalk- 
It came off that mean plant.

Magic WaterMagic Water- 
Huh. Is it a water drop, or a seed?

Asparagus SeedsAsparagus Seeds- 

Radish SeedsRadish Seeds- 

Don't Starve Together
Royal JellyRoyal Jelly- 
It's goopy.
We can find out what they are by planting them.
We can find out what they are by planting them.
Let's plant these and see what grows.

We can find out what they are by planting them.
'Follow the instructions', mum always said.
I wish I'd been a robot.
Funk to funky.
Whatever it was, it's gone back to the earth.
It feels warm even on the coldest nights.
Glittering and cool.
Yellow-bellied gem.
I'm absolutely green with envy.
Orange you glad we found you, gem?
In another life, I could've grown this.
Doodoo.
Bat doodoo.
We could've had some fun if they weren't all melted.
A voiceless instrument.
It won't come undone!
It's watching us.
Yay, a new toy!
Maybe we'll find a use for these.
Another toy!
We could take a bath if only we had a tub.
None of them match!
Just like grandpa wears!
Beep boop!
Feels leathery.
Cozy.
How did this get here?
Boney bits.
We're ankle-deep in knowledge!
The key to feeling better if we get sick.
Shiny coins!
Brrr!
Maybe there's a comic book in here!
It's no good to anyone now.
It really works!
It's awful sharp.
We feel like a god with this in our hands!
This be our smackin' leg.
Is it our birthday!
Reminds me of Teddy...
I wonder if it's in tune.
Where's the automobile?
This is a lot older than we are.
What's a brain cloud?
What was in the bottle?
Where did the words go?
This belonged to a pirate!
Too big for us...
It's very shiny.
Yaaaay!
We probably can't light that.
Is this a toy?
A thing for opening other things.
What will it open?
The key's probably worth more than what it unlocks.
We want to wear it.
What can we buy with this?
Mom said we should always save for a rainy day.

Executive HammerExecutive Hammer- 
For knocking down our city so we can build it again.
Wonder if someone would want this.
This is probably important to someone.
Someone would treasure this.

The Jeweled TruffleThe Jeweled Truffle- 

PherostonePherostone- 
Smells like bugs. It's nice.
Gosh. That's a lot of metal.
Hope no one's missing that.
This should make it easier to walk.
Wow. Now we can have a roof over our head!
It's a really cool stick!

Key to the CityKey to the City- 

Queen MalfalfaQueen Malfalfa- 
Neat! Bet someone would trade us for this.
Do we have anyone we could send this to?
Haha! Fun!
WX eats them by the fistful!
We could still play with these, if we’re extra creative.
I miss bath toys.
Pretty petals!
I think it's listening to us!
It's getting creepy!
It gives us itches and skritches up our spine!
Put it down! Put it down!
Scary blossoms!
If we talk to it will it talk back?
Is there going to be a party?!
Balloon animals! Balloon animals!!
I don't think we should play with that...
This one feels special.
Fluffy and not from a spider.
We need somewhere to make it!
It has fishing secrets!
This key is REALLY old.
Why does it make me feel so bad?
It's watching us.
We want some hot cocoa.
We don't know how to play this game.
Spork. Spork. Spork. Hahaha!
We like toys.
This toy doesn't work very well.
Can we dig in the dirt with this?
Mom had one of these.
It's kinda like our webbing!
Are we supposed to blow on it?
We can't follow the rules if we don't know them.
No cookies. Yet!
It's stinky.
You're our cuppy cup!
Maybe Maxwell will teach us how to play.
This is stupid.
Hey! Did anyone lose an eye?
We could always use more eyes!
That rock needs a nap. Its eye is all red!
This rock helps me find my friends!
Now we won't need to leave a trail of breadcrumbs!
Even with all our eyes, we'd still lose in a staring contest.
We see eight million eyes reflecting back at us. Neat!
Whew. Gotta be careful where you point it!
Woah! The cold makes all our hairs stand up!
Sand castles!
We hope the stuff inside didn't get smushed.
Play time is over.

AshesThing Ashes- 

Divining RodDivining Rod (before picked up from its starting base)- 
Radical rod!
Lead and I shall follow.
Nothing nearby.
Going the right way.
Something must be near.
We are close!
It's a mystery.
Looks like there's a hole for an oversized key.
It's ready to go.
Something wicked this way comes.
We could listen to that forever!
Well, these would've been handy before.
That's the guy who said he could help us.
Who would put this here? We could get hurt!
Eek!
Gross, that one looks sick!
It's missing something.
That throne makes our skin crawl.
He doesn't look like he's having much fun.
She's locked up!
I don't think it's having fun.
We're still a little mad at him. But only a little.
Can we play with it?
We made it!
Brrr... spider hair isn't very warm.
En garde!
We will put you in our web!
We hate it! Horrible pig!
Hey, wanna play?
Why can't we just get along?!
Well, we would have won!
Speedy thing!
Another day, pig.
It's better this way.
Simmer down, friend.
I just can't mosquito you.
Almost time for bed.
We can't see! I want my night light.
Phew, light.
It's too dark to see!
That's off-limits.
We're missing something.
Nope, don't think so!
It's daytime, not bedtime.
We're not ready for bed.
Our tummy is rumbling, we can't sleep.
Can't sleep with monsters nearby!
We can try again when it's finished.
We should probably keep it.
Aww... It's sleepy-snoozy right now!
Not good enough for you, plant?
Doggies are coming!
Ohhh nooo. We're not friends with worms!
That sounded like a big meanie.
Our pockets are full.
All full!
That's breaking the rules.
I don't want to. Mom always said the kitchen was dangrous!
Let's scurry closer!
It's not shaving time!
Clean as a whistle.
It's hairy like us, but I don't think it likes shaving.
We can't write on that now.
It's too angry!
All our arms can't quite reach from up here.
Yummy in our tummy!
Stale like mum's leftovers.
Past its date.
Our tummy hurts.
It's time for a snack!
Eek!
Waah, our light went out!
Yowch!
We can repair it.
I don't think that was our tummy.
We're invincible!
Hot as heck!
Protect us, tree!
Splishy splashy!
Uncomfortably moist.
Wet as a bathtub we can't crawl out of.
We're drenched!
Come back, tool!
That thing is about to catch fire.
Jeepers! That was hot!
That sounded like a big meanie.
Mum always said 'Don't sleep in a burning building.'
I don't think that was our tummy.
It's raining fire!
Mean sea hounds! Leave us alone!
Doggies are coming!
That sounded like a big meanie.
I don't like this...
We're trembling in our pantaloons!
That was scary!
Weee!
Our boat's hurt!
The water is too rough!
Down, down, down we go!
Let's pull 'er up!
You slippery snail...er, crabbit!
I don't think I can find this treasure here.

Bats! I hope they won't hurt us.
Mom told me never to do that.
That's against the rules.
So wet!
I like the pet we've got.
Everything's back!
Hopefully we're venomous!
oOooOooO!!
Our hairy friend is hurt!
We didn't climb into the saddle in time!
The boat is crying!
We're too young to drown!
I'm pretty sure one of us knows that one.
Ms. Wickerbottom will have to explain this one.
Is it upside down? Nope. It's just wrong.
Doesn't work. We probably need to see the moon or something.
Aw, we don't wanna mess up someone else's stuff.
It doesn't go there.
We need stuff to build with.
I don't think these are the right plans.
Ooo, make something tasty!
It's okay, we can wait for you to finish!
Are you finding everything okay in there?
Warly gets upset when we play with his things.
We'll get our crayons ready while they finish up!
This two piece puzzle sure is hard!
I think that'd make it angry.
I think the sky is falling!
Uh oh, I broke it.
Can't! There's scary-biteys about!
Everything's getting fuzzy!
Wendy would've been so happy if it worked.
We don't think we even want them to come back.
Oh, someone's calling us to come over.
We're becoming... even more monstrous!
We don't feel so good right now. Maybe later?
Ah! I'm sorry we killed your deer!!
Uh-oh, it's got friends coming!
That doesn't go there!
It's too dangerous!
We're here!
We'll get you out.
Almost!
You're free!
It needs a special kind of log!
It needs a mushroom!
It doesn't fit right!
We'd rather keep this one for ourselves.
Yuck!
Doesn't that feel better!
That doesn't look like food to us.
We can't, we won't, we refuse to eat that.
The trees are yelling at us!!
We have something for you!
Um. We should probably keep it.
Hey! Make room!
Aww... They're getting their snoozies right now!
We'll open it later as a celebration of surviving this!
I promise I'll ride you again after I open my present!
Aw, we wanted to do it!
There's too much glass in the way.
I can't! It's all burny!
Our fur is soaking wet!
Aaw, the twirly is gone.
We're so capable!
We're a super hero!
We like parties!
I want to go home, but we can't find the way.
Come closer - we are hungry!
Raaar! ...That's our bat noise.
We don't want to fight if we don't have to.
If you fight us, you will lose.
The rose shelters our fur from the morning dew.
We love playing in the snow!
Let's get cooking!
Look, we lost a tooth!
Don't mess with us.
We're like a walking volcano.
Grrrr... We're scary!
Imagine the trouble he has buying hats!
Who knows what could be hiding in there!
We can do some fancy forking with this.
All these legs, but we don't row.
Hellooo? We're here!
So close, so far away.
It's in our way!
Little pig, little pig, let me in!
Some pretty average earth.
Some ground that we dug up.
It was once grass.
This lava's all dried up.
Cozy!
It's a little less cozy.
It looks like it might break.
I just can't mosquito you.
Suck someone else's blood!

ANNOUNCE_NO_TRAP- 
Easy peasy.
What a crummy item.
Gah! It needs more time.

I can't wield that.
Rocks from an old city.
Owie!
Sometimes scary things are nice.

These seeds are a good start.
We can plant a whole bunch of food with this.
Wow. There's a few different seeds in here.
We can grow a bunch of things from these seeds.
Wow. A big mix of different food to plant.
We know how to dish it out!

Just a little snack.
Yay! Bread!

Mom said we should always eat our vegetables.
Mmmm... I'm hungry.
Still smells a little.
I bet this tastes great.
Cheese is good for the bones.
Sweet!
If we get licked by those we'll get sick.
Such pretty feathers!
Eep!
AHH!
The machine that makes the hyper juice!
One fancy piece of cloth.
Perhaps we'll hook something good.

I can hear some spider friends down there.
Did you hear something?
Wake up, friend!
He will protect us!
They're so cute when they sleep.
Another lost friend.
Stop! Thief!
We should just squish you.
We are accomplished chefs!
I could've been a robot.
It looks like grandpa's.
I'm learning so much!
It's almost like being back in school.
That might've taught a toddler something.
There's not even any stubble left!
We shoot it!
I better point this away from myself.
Like shooting fireworks!
Keeps the wet stuff out.
I can't read, but he can!
This tree holds many secrets of this place.
Sea litter.
It's a bunch of stony stones.
No one's going through this.
As if pirates weren't scary enough!
What playful little rubbery blobs.
1, 2...4 legs. Thought you were maybe a friend.
It would look good in a cooking pot!
It would seem my future is foggy.
I think I felt something brush against my leg...
Even the sea gets weeds!
Its suffering is over.
It's covered in limpets.
All gone.
I'm taking my saddle and leaving.
We have failed him.
We like playing hide-and-seek in wardrobes.

Uh-oh! That looks bad!
Thanks birds!
Do your kids want to play?
Looks kinda creepy.
We can have a cookout!
What do you want to cook?
This unlocks the gate to that park.

Would eating this kind of make us like a turducken?
We're sure this is cooked human meat.
Dried human meat.
Maybe we'll find another use for this.
No cookies.
It's looking around for a way out.
Aww, the frog left!
I want to go home.
A trusty companion in these environs.
A golden chopper!
I'm not the landscaping type.

If only I had aftershave.
For tenderizing boeuf!
Proper farm gear.
Lighter than my meringue.
For tidying unkempt beast hair.

Durable.
Adds a little spice to my ride.
It's like a spatula for a saddle.

I could chop a lot of onions with this!
Fancy slicer.
Good for cutting hedges and grass.
A simple way to weigh!
To keep the dark at bay.
To warm my fingers and roast sausages.
The flames climb higher!
Maximum heat!
I should like to sit by you for a moment.
Parfait.
It is getting low.
I should stoke the fires
I shall have to light you again.
I like when it's warm and toasty.
Not much for caramelizing creme brulee, but it will do for seeing.
Aha! Now that is using my head!
Trick 'R neat!
It is my night light.
Fire that cools?
The flames climb higher!
I should like to sit by you for a moment.

I wonder if this could be converted into a pizza oven?
Shine on!
To warm my fingers and roast sausages.
Maximum heat!
This fire's on fire!
It's getting low.
That fire's almost out!
I like when it's warm and toasty.
What a rustic delight!
Is this a fire hazard, or a boating hazard?
Goodness! It's a grease fire!
It's burning steady.
Looks a bit dim.
Worryingly low.
I can't cook without a fire!
Handy for some nighttime cooking.
Ah, I can see through the eyes of a bat.
Sometimes, you need a break.
I do like being able to see.

I do prefer the fish market...
A little better than raw ground.
Cozy.

Fresh-picked produce!
Needs to be fertilized.
Ah the Ice Box, she calms me.

Not quite dry enough.

I'll have to sacrifice caviar ingredients for this.
Just think, market fresh fish every morning!
Should I make a fish stew with thyme and onion?
Oh! Boiled fish with celery and goat pepper?
Maybe a chowder with hot pepper and shrimp stock!
Let the cook off begin!
It garnishes the plants with water.
The ice box, my second-most loyal culinary companion.
I could grow some fresh mushrooms here.
Oh, my mushrooms are beginning to grow!
It's nice not to have to forage for the basics.
My days of wild mushroom hunting are over!
I'll need to find a replacement if I want fresh mushrooms.
Mmm, smells like fried mushrooms.
Mushrooms are out of season right now.
It has greatly improved my culinary adventures.
Fresh spices! Oh, how I have missed you!
Pickup! Oh, old habits...
A centre for learning.
Oh, the things I'll learn!
Splendid. I should like to know when the worm is going to turn.
It measures moisture in the clouds.
I do feel a bit safer now.
Electricity!
Boom!
That didn't cook very well.
The fire seemed to like it.
Foresight is 0/0.
It measures exactly nothing now...
He's sleeping.
Make it snow!
Shall I fuel it up?
Positively charged to get my hands on one!
Couldn't hurt to hit the books now and then.
A small luxury.
Whistle while you work!
It's still running.
Nearly out!
Doesn't smelt as good as bacon frying.
Good ventilation in the kitchen is an must.
It's run dry.
It's tres heavy!
I hope my penmanship is legible.
Oh dear!
Well, that won't help our explorations much.
Just need some stone to get cooking.
Overcooked.
That doesn't seem right.
Ready for the chisel.
I'd have to take the other object out first.
Someone's a very talented artist.
We've learned that already.
All the knowledge of a seasoned seafarer!
It's all gone up in smoke.
I always wished to make a name for myself.
For kebab-ing.
Mmm, ham popsicle!
Oh good, I have separation anxiety.
Ouch! Stupid, horrible thing!
They won't know what hit them.
A sleep aid!
Breathing fire!
Made from pork, to protect my melon.
How much protection can grass provide?
Sturdy, but flammable.
Weighs a ton.
Weaponized bees.
This is not a cruelty-free trap.
Heavy and hot.
I feel electric!
Does nature like being tamed?
Would make me sick to use this on good meat.
A coward's weapon, alas...
Weaponized food.
This will only burn for so long before...
Now we're cooking!
En garde!
Much more waterproof than a chef's hat.
Seashell mail.
With this I will be a stone man.
If I prick enemies half as much as I pricked myself making it, it'll be worth it.
I dislike fighting.
It's light enough.
It still smells of bug.
The pith has been removed.
There's no meat inside.
I prefer a chef hat.
Like an armor made of tin cans.
The meat is more tender if the death is quick.
I don't have the confidence to pull it off like she does.
I'm better with a spatula.
It's positively electric.
I'd rather whip up a nice meringue.
Bonne nuit, everybody.
Not the best looking hat, but c'est la vie.
Suitable lodging for a feathered beast.
I now have an egg farm!
Sleep now, lay later.
Can I blow this down?
Looks like more than 3 little piggies in there.
Yoo hoo! Anybody home?
Do my eyes deceive me?
Hay look, a wall!
Calling it a wall is kind of a stretch.
Turns in a wooden performance as a wall.
Putting down stakes.
I feel secure behind this.
Good stone work.
Treasure!
What's the use in a sign around here?
Nature. Tamed.

Mmmm BBQ!
That was no carrot!
That is what I expected.
Wood burns. Who knew? Me!?
Its treasure-chesting days are over.
Ooh la la, burnproof storage.
Overcooked.
How calming.
It looks at home here.
How wild can they be if they live in houses?
Someone has a hoarding issue.
Citrus-infused walls!
Zesty wall.
I do not like these fellows one bit.
I was hoping it would be full of potatoes.
Helps keep my dry environment dry.
Bonjour!
Looks like a rickety ride to someplace...
A beacon to light my way.
I probably shouldn't keep perishables in it.
They're quite social creatures, no?
I could probably place this at sea without issue.
Good and strong.
Pest control.

Très royal!
The throne has been charbroiled!
You have all the ingredients you need?
It's been burnt to a crisp!
A bit too thick to tie up a roast.
Sigh. It would be so perfect for grilling salmon.
Compressed stones, nice presentation.
I could write down my recipes on this.
It holds deep secrets.
Who in their right mind would want to fuel MORE nightmares?
A first-rate preservative.
Wax paper! Always useful in the kitchen.
Soft and crisp, all at once.
Made from petit fishy skeletons.
I wonder what vintage used to be in this bottle...
No coral in sight. Perhaps later.
It feeds on fertilizer.
An eye without an iris.
I don't think this bean is edible.
This fabric is light as a feather!
Part of my soul is within.
I won't even try to pronounce it...
It boggles the mind.
This will be music to somethings ears.
And I thought fluorescent tubes were a bad invention!
Am I crazy to wear this?
This thing controls like a dream!
What a racket!
A gruesome implement.
My appetite wanes...
Brrrrrr!
I must be crazy to fool around with this.
I wear safety.
Oven on a stick!
Flash freeze poulet all over the place!
Let us take a trip. I am not picky where.
It is operational.
It requires more purple gems.
Voila!
Gem it!
It won't be much good now.
Nothing but ashes.
The darkness is all burnt up.
Should I ring it?
This reminds me of something...
It played its last magic trick.
It plays a lilting tune.
Could I fry those wings as well?

Pugalisk WandPugalisk Wand- 
It's a refrigeration ray.
A whole new world of ingredients.
Any good restaurants in there?
Will it help me be a better cook?
Mon dieu! What a wonderful time saver!
Marinated in darkness.
It's watching over us.
I hope the birds get to enjoy it, too.
The new moon's arrive.
The moon is waxing.
The full moon's arrived.
The moon is waning.
It doesn't seem very useful down here.
Is someone coming for dinner?
Ready to receive the dinner guests.
You're mastering this curse business, mon ami!
Well... that certainly is... something.
Excusez-moi, but why does this smell like meat?
Not exactly my specialty.
Ahh, fuzzy!
Now I am on island time.
Fits perfectly.
Essential honey harvesting attire.
What am I supposed to do with this?
I know when to don this and not a minute sooner.
For a night out on the... town...
I feel so much better all of a sudden.
Fashionably refreshing.
Toasty and trendy.
Snacks to go?
Who doesn't look good in this?!
Now we are cooking with gas!
Not quite my style...
Aaaahhhhhh sweet relief...
Must I wear it?
For a foggy Paris evening. Or here too...
Better than a newspaper.
Well, it'll be hard to lose.
When in Rome...
Eye like it!
Furry refuge from the elements.
I can feel the inspiration seeping into me! Wait, that's brain juice.
Tres cool.
Function and fashion and four less snakes in the world.
Desperate times call for desperate attire.
It is rude to break wind in public, but I will make an exception.
I hope there are no feathers around!
Anything to keep poison out of my dinner!
Speeds me on my way.
Look upon your king!
Ridiculous! I want one.
I could use this in the smoke house.
Orange pith?
Not a chef hat but good for a night out.
Oh. I've never considered myself fashionable before!
Goggles would be quite useful. I need my eyes.
Wearing mushrooms is the next best thing to eating them.
I'd rather have this in a broth than on my head.
Mon dieu, must I dress as a frog?
Thule... thule... rolls off the tongue does it not?
The stories these tell... fascinating...
Look at the carvings...
It appears all is well.
I feel some magic coming on!
Magic hour!
Steady on.
Subsiding.
This nightmare is almost over!
Magic-less.
Here one minute, gone the next!
Puts some pep in my step!
For more savvy construction!
When I hold it it makes the world feel... fast.
I could stir a huge pot with this thing!
I probably shouldn't stir soup with this.
Oh I get it! Kind of like a spork!
Seems unnecessarily fancy.
Ancient armor.
I could tenderize some meat with this.
Wake up!
This is my friend, Lazer Oeil!
These logs might be better suited to a fire...
Better than swimming, I suppose.
Free me from the shackles of this island!
For long distance hauls.
I am comforted by its sea-worthiness.
It's a bit wobbly.
Is that as fast as it goes?
A most sensible traveling companion.
This should speed things up.
Now we're cooking with gas!
Perhaps I'll sail to a land of spices.
I mostly want to pet it.
Zoom zoom!
A light so I may sea.
To sea what's coming!
I cannon wait to use this!
Excuse me everyone, out of my way, please.
I can trick some delicious crustaceans into this!
Ah, I can't fix my boat right now.
Is my boat in need of a touch up?
It seems to be running low.
I suppose I should turn it on.
It's extracting tar quite vigorously!
It looks a bit peckish.
Ah! The life of a fisherman!
I hope the sea obliges my net with worthy catches.
It is close to full.
It is definitely filling up.
To see how near I am to far.
I knew sharks had an exceptional sense of smell, but their vision!
I have been promoted!
I do not go in with these scoundrels. But I like the hat...
It makes me feel... dangerous.
Better safe than sorry.
A shaky sea vessel.
You can overheat swinging this thing too much.
You really build up a head of steam swinging this!
Pull the trigger and voila! Dinner is done!
Heavy and hot.
These are a blast!
The meat inside is gone, but the shell itself may still be of use.
Might make a good stirring stick.
One must be careful with this.
Disarmingly simple to use.
This will tenderize the jewels out of statues.
I have better pans.
To see the finest details.
What a quaint street lamp.
It's a small comfort.
It's a simple life.

EvergreenEvergreen- 
A soldier of the exotic forest.
A coneless arbre.
I am ever so glad I'm not a tree hugger.
Sliced!
There, now you cannot prick anyone.
Au revoir, tree.
You will not be missed.
Crisp, no?
The wood gives off a unique aroma when burned.
One day you'll be a tree.
An important aspect of my art.
Soon it won't be good for much.
This, a grill and some meat and I'd have dinner.
Pine-scented!
How supremely unnatural!
Tres suspicious...
Magic building blocks!
Those could be key to my continued survival.
There is nothing left for me to grasp!
Those burn quite nicely.
Shall I bring it back to life?
The start of a good cooking fire.
A common ingredient for success around here.
Plucked clean!
Could I get some fertilizer over here!
I never burn anything in the kitchen.
What shall I craft?
Berries!
More will return.
They require care and fertilizer.
A small clump of reeds.
There's nothing left to take.
The fire took to those quite nicely.
Smells like green.
I wonder if it is edible.

PlantPlant (ready to be picked)- 

Spiky BushSpiky Bush- 
A prickly customer.
Not sure I want to do that again.
It burns like any other bush.
Charmant.
Great in salads.
It even looks crazy!
Not so great in salads.
Ah a fresh carrot!
Can't get fresher than that!
It'll be hard to harvest like that.
There's nothing there.
Little champignon!
Did it eat itself...?
I eagerly await its rebirth!
Ah, a blue truffle!
It retreats from the light.
I hope there is room for more mush...
A bouquet of leaves.
Sliced!
Au revoir, tree.
Crisp, no?
A new beginning...
It could use some love.
Too hot for you.
The heat has stifled these berries.

BirchnutBirchnut- 
It rattles.
I bet it has a sharp flavor.
It will live to prick again.
What secrets do you hold?
A tuft of usefulness.
Gigantesque!
I do wish those were grapevines...
More will sprout in time.
Sliced!
How divine! It has been de-vined.
Au revoir, tree.
A waste.
Crisp, no?
That smoky aroma always makes me hungry...
Shall I bring it back to life?
Now I can put it wherever I want.
Cute, no?
Could be fashioned into chopsticks...
Not a single grape on it...
Herbe at sea.
Chewy rock, with a clever finish.
Sea produce!
I wonder what its water content is?
I'd say its current water content is zero.
A good leaning tree.
Evidence of a coconut uneaten. Sigh.
These would work well in tamales.
Pardon, but are you sleeping?
Inedible.
A bit grotesque.

Claw Palm Tree BurntClaw Palm Tree (burnt)-

Seed PodSeed Pod- 
More useful as medicine than in my recipe.

Tuber TreeTuber Tree- 
I do like tubers.

Tall GrassTall Grass- 
Too long to cut it with my hands.

Exotic FlowerExotic Flower- 
Edible? Perhaps not.
A plant of many uses. And recipes.
I should snatch those up.
What ravishing radishes!
Ah. Smells like eucalyptus.
I do hope it grows back.
The soil is over-cooking it.
Ah, it's keeps moist with a marinade.
I'll find somewhere to plant this.
Watch those thorns!
It would make a beautiful centerpiece.
How eerie.
What a marvel.
Mmm, lotus root...
I doubt it has much flavor.
I can think of plenty of uses for those.
How charming!
It's a hedge.
I could shave it like a carrot.

Hedge (burnt)- 

Intricate Topiary- 
Very impressive.
It looks hungry.
A barbeque spit.
Pity there are no berries on it.
A fine stick.
Strange place for a tree.
Mon dieu!
Just a petite bébé.
What a shame.
It's a tree made of kabob sticks.
No more for now.
It, oh, it appears to be on fire.
Crisp, no?
That tree looks like it's on its way out.
Just a petite bébé.
It will grow into a fine tree.
It's coming down with something.
It's starting to look a little funny.
I think it's coming down with a little something.
Would some nice soup make you feel better?
It's under the weather.
It's got food poisoning.
Berries!
I can't wait for more.
It's burning down!
No more fresh berries for my desserts.
Now I can have fresh berries wherever I please!
It's much too hot, I agree.
Just a petite marble bébé.
If marble beans can grow, maybe they can be eaten.
Confections flavored with rose water, perhaps?
What an adorable little plant.
I wonder if I can find some culinary use for this.
Salad of the sea!
She needs time to regrow, non?
Perhaps it'll grow if I plant it.
This tree's spent too much time at sea.
All nicely chopped.
Driftwood en flambé!
Charred to a crisp.
It's surprisingly light.
What a strange looking tree.
Nothing but a stump left.
It's on fire!
Quel dommage.
How lovely!
Grow big and strong, little tree!
What a strange looking shrub!
I must be patient.
It's all out of fruit.
It's withered from the heat.
I think something's wrong with it.
That doesn't look healthy.
Did I leave the stove on?
Let's find somewhere to plant this.
I can hear the activity within.
Not your average bees.
Just add milk!
It smells wet.
Hmm, soup stock...
Looks like some sort of ritual stone.
It's tugging on my mind.
Do not lick it. Your tongue will get stuck.
And I'm in!
The darkness lurks within.
Headless harps-men.
I wonder how many counter tops I could get out of this...
Would make a nice counter top.
Fisher folk live here. I can smell it.
Its odor is not improving with time...
Ooh la la the things I could do with you!
I wonder what it means?
Made of strong stuff!
Don't you go rolling off me.
Bite-sized boulders.
Sharp as can be!
How curious.
Yolk yellow glowing gold!
I cannot help wondering what might be down there besides...
What have I become?
It's making a bit of a mess, isn't it?
These tracks point to fresh game.
I have lost the trail...
Game is close at hand...
It leads somewhere. And that is what I'm afraid of.
It requires something additional.
It denies my access.
Where we shall go, thing?
One ring to teleport them all!
Definitely for a cranking action for some kind.
This likely connect to a that.
This I do not even...
Am I really doing this?
That is no ordinary tooth-lined hole in the ground!
I must be unhinged to travel so...
I can't see the bottom...
I have a bone to pick with you.
A spider has to live somewhere, I suppose.
This is probably a delicacy somewhere.
Thump twice if you are fat and juicy.
Some outdoorsy types made this.
Yes, vacancy.
Hey fella, need a wing?
Where did he go?
Could be a piece of the ship...
That's ice.
Brr!
It's just liquid now.
The trail is washed out...
It is a nice hill, but I won't make a mountain of it.
What a pity rabbit season has ended.
That fire got the smell out.
I think it needs to burned again! Pee-eew!
Not even the cheeks are left...
How many critters can fit in there?
Vacant of critters.
Must have been a pretty important... thingy...
Ooops...
I have a bone to pick with... m-me?
Yikes! That boat had baaaad luck.
Come out, come out!
Fisherfolk live here. I can smell it.
That fire got the smell out.
Shining, sparkling snacks.
I am waiting for you!
A rainbow sea rock.
What shall I make with you?
Bonjour, mon petit amie.
A petit snail farm!
I have a soft spot for bivalves!
This rocks.
Watch that flame!
Please have fresh underwear inside!
The sand has formed a small pile.
Lots of tiny stones.
That seems like something I should steer clear of.
A pile of sand like any other.
Oh, this gets better and better...
What use is an egg that you cannot eat?
What the deuce?
The beast has slipped by me!
How can I track anything in this deluge!
The beast is close.
I think there's tar down there.
Adds a truly unique flavor to licorice.
The slowed pace gives you time to enjoy the scenery.
It traps snacks.
Spicy!
A delightful seafood dinner dwells there.
Stick with me, mussels. I'll take you places!
Maybe I'll win something tasty?
Shouldn't I boat away from these?
Any cold drinks in there?
This leaves a bad taste in my mouth...
I hope a rations shipment lies within.
Is someone making a gourmet jerky?
What a pretty shell.
I smell trouble...
Skull and cross bones is bad, yes?
What shall I find?
Your hair needs a brushing.
Let's open her up.
It sails no more.
It leads somewhere. And that is what I am afraid of.
Definitely for a cranking action of some kind.
'This' likely connects to a 'that.'
This, I do not even...
One ring to teleport them all!
There may be some protein under there.

Dung PileDung Pile- 
The smell is so strong I can taste it.
Non.
Any eggs in there?
I hope he stays asleep.
I'm staying away from that guy.
Not sure those ribs are good for BBQing.
Could I serve it up with roast potatoes?
I wonder what I could cook up with this.
It's been seasoned with gold.
Perhaps that nosey fellow would like to eat this.
I'd rather have a mound of chocolate.
Mining is a dangerous job.
I've found it!
Not the best place to hide, I think.

Mant HillMant Hill- 
I could take a peek inside.
A fine place for a light.
I suppose pigs lived here once.
A sturdy enough wall.
Locally sourced water, free of impurities.

Ominous Carving-

Not very hearty.

Not working.
'Allo?
Is anyone else coming for dinner?
That's almost definitely bigger than before.
I don't think that honey would taste very good.
I don't remember this being here.
Parts of it look like they were sculpted.
Some old, worn stone.
What an odd shape for a rock.
Where is your nose?
It looks incomplete.
It's looking for its missing piece.
That looks nice.
It looks much better.
Well, it's fixed now.
I think... it's stirring!
That looks a little toasty.
Looks like a rock to me.
A kitchen mishap, maybe?
She seems regal.
Well, as they say, if it ain't baroque!
A lovely marble statue.
It has a very peaceful energy.
A little piece of sky to hold in my hand.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
It seems dangerous, but it's oddly calming.
My mechanical friend seems intent on fixing it.
What goes in the middle, I wonder?
I thought something would have happened.
That looks ripe for the taking.
I think it wants something else.
I think it's breakable.
Did someone sculpt that?
I could use a friend in this difficult world.
Poor %s was overcome by %s.
Oh, what a nice table setting.
I've got to hand it to you, I was startled!
That doesn't look like a natural rock.
Looks like it came off a sculpture somewhere.
I think it was part of a statue.
It won't begin to move, will it?
I feel strangely uneasy.
There might be all sorts of treats inside.
I could use a little break.
I'm sure I'm strong enough to move it.
I can't get at it.
That's an unusual looking starfish.
Don't take a bite out of me!
Ha! I'm nobody's snack!
You know how to get me home to maman?
Nearly there, mon ami!
Hm? Where would you like to go, mon ami?
Oui, I'll take you back where you belong.
Of course I can take you home.
It's giving me goosebumps.
It looks like it goes down forever.
Ah, if only I had time for a nice soak.
What a nice aroma.
It looks quite pretty in the moonlight, non?
An empty basin.
There's something inside that wants out.
That's quite a bit of glass.
My, that's sharp!
Hmm... that might be good in a soup.
A big lumpy rock.
Something is different about that spider den...

Oh, divine tree of mushrooms--what else can you teach me?
Ah, a light in the dark.
Looks like candy.
I always get you upside down with stalactites...
Rocks to be had.
I have no reason to investigate any further.

Safe at last.

Mant omelet, perhaps?
There are many cherries hidden in that fruit salad.
I wonder what the kitchen is like.
Like fine wine, it is to be admired behind glass.

A new species of irritation.
If only you were more turkey than vulture...
What perky little ears.
Chat noodle.
I had a goat once.
Goat milkshake!
For kabobs, perhaps?
Why the long fishface?
That is quite a lot of dead whale.
Chipper fellows.
I'd imagine that hurt.
Meduse.
Electric meduse for dinner?
Here's the beef!
A lovely souvenir from a once powerful beast.
You reek of mischief and other kinds of reek.
Does not look like a placid piggy.
Loud root vegetable.
Those horns would make great roasting spits.
It's too bad I couldn't use this to roast wieners on.
Let's break bread, friend.
Good night, mon amie.
He's met an untimely end.
He could skewer me!
It's sharp!
Great for feeding my kitchen scraps!
I'm not looking for trouble, friend.
Our little friend is not quite ripe.
You'd be perfect in a meal!
Sleep well, you tasty morsel.
Your aerial dance is so soothing to behold...
I hope you don't slip from my butter fingers.
Raven stew perhaps?
Shush, my pet.
Good afternoon, sir or madam!
It's soft, and surprisingly calm.
This little fellow seems quite frigid.
Let me lend you my warmth, feathered friend.
A bird's feather, in truffle black.
A bird's feather, in cherry red.
A bird's feather, in tuna blue.
A fellow with excellent taste.
Its eye follows me wherever I go...
It sleeps.
The eyebone was sacrificed in my travels.
You look cute and inedible.
I haven't had rabbit in awhile...

A dash of glow.
My petit lightbulb pets.
Have I discovered a new root vegetable?!
Do not pick! Do not pick!
I should like to get to the root of this mystery...
Could use... an explanation...
My head... spinning...
I think I like it.
Tres beau!
What a waste.
It is no more.
A tiny delicacy.
Looks like bubblegum, tastes like floor.
Something dwells beneath there...
Are you spying on me?
Do you 'dig' your new surroundings?
Magnifique...
Soon you will be a crab cake.
I can smell you, my sweet!
You'll make a fine filet.
Veal of the sea.
Picked clean...
I miss ash covered cheeses. I miss cheeses, period.
You have a big mouth, mister.
I see no reason to bother it.
You might go well in a stew.
I can't recall any parrot recipes...
Such an amiable creature. Friends?
I know you're just after my cooking.
You are all nose.
The caviar delivery service.
I see potential in this poultry.
It will become tastier with time.
A feather from my feathered friend.
Hello, breakfast.
Spoiled egg?
Bon appetit!
I should let it grow into more food.

It's just resting.
Demised.
Pigeon pie? No, perhaps not.
Perhaps a feast of seeds has worn it out.
Squab?
Not how I would spend my days.

Dormez bien, mon amie.

Already has a nice golden braise.

Dreaming of nuts, no doubt.
An unfortunate end.

I don't want any trouble.
A nice ingredient for a hat.
It doesn't seem dangerous.
He's a cheery little fishstick.
He's missing his other half.
Just my cute little breadbox.
Sing me your sweet song, mon amie.
Bonjour monsieur.
The poor thing!
A bird's feather, in lemon yellow.
Happy as a deliciously seasoned clam.
She's a fiery little one.
You are hungry, non? Let me whip something up.
I should cook something for her, fast!
Is its flavor profile comparable to a regular egg?
Nice and cozy.
Are you chilly, ma petite choux-fleur?
It came off my petite fiery friend.
Yuck. I should wash my hands before I prepare food.
Imagine... succulent venison bourguignon.
Shouldn't they have two antlers?
It looks like a key, does it not?
Hm, I don't think I've cooked one of those before.
What a cute little morsel!
I think it's asleep.
I... think I had a nightmare like this once.
Would you be a meat or a vegetable?
Bonne nuit.
I wonder what you'd taste like.
Oh, how lovely!
Hello my little friend!
Leggy.
No vacancy here.
Empty nest syndrome is setting in.
I wonder what its incubation period is?
Could use fried tomato and beans...
There is activity!

Tallbird Egg Too HotHatching Tallbird Egg (too hot)- 
I hope you don't hard boil.
Oh you poor egg you are so cold!
This is going to take some dedication.
A hatching is in the offing!
Hello food... uh, friend.
I suppose I could whip something up for you.
You look famished!
You are sort of tall, I guess...
Teenagers, always hungry!
Are you trying to eat me out of base and home?
Gah! Enough!
I'm out of my element!
I will not bend the knee to the likes of you!
Well, it is on my head now. Best make the most of it.
I once had a saucier who looked like that.
Giant eyeball... soup?
Stay away!
I wonder, if ground up into a powder...
Oh, I don't like you one bit!
Feels warm.
I wish you were a little less moosey and a lot more goosey!
By cracky I think I'll leave this egg quite alone!
Looking for your momma? I hope you do not find her.
A plucked goose was here.
I'm not cut out for this.
Hot to the touch!
A chef-cuisinier never burns his fingers.
The top has cooled, barf creme brulee!
Let us not do anything we will regret, uh... sir...
I can't take the heat! Get me out of this kitchen!
My poisons do nothing!
What treasures do you hold?
Imagine the meals it could've eaten with that thing!
Nature's blender!

SealSealnado (seal form)- 
I bet it's delicious, but I just don't have the heart to find out.
Could work in a food processor.
It's just dripping with magicks!
I wish you were a tiger shrimp instead!
Well, it's edible.
It won't be needing these anymore.
Pardon me, Monsieur.
Bones always make for a good broth.
I can't roast this marrow.
I won't use this for soup.
I have no grief with you, madam.
I have no desire to be a leader.
Mon dieu! He is frightening.
Not a fan of the dark motif but it may prove useful.
Must be hungry after that long sleep.

You! You...villain!
Well, you've got the chops for it.
I'll get you out, mon ami!
Apparition!
Please do not squish me!
Salutations, my good simian fellow!
Try not to think about his delicious tentacles...
Where'd he go?
That's three mouths to feed!
Chicken legs for days!
Think of the rump roast I could make!
What a tasty dish!
I think it's friendly.
Life is good right now.
Oh no, don't be mad.
The sensation takes some getting used to.
Well, it will be quicker at least.
Watch yourself, it's quite sharp.
Very thick sand.
I prefer my decor a smidge less... stabby.
Reminds me of the ice sculptures in the ship's dining hall.
Can you... get me home to dear Maman?
Bonjour, %s!
Let's all calm down with a nice bowl of soup.
Mon dieu! You're a murderer!
You've been a big help, %s.
Oh my. Does that hurt?
I don't want to nitpick how you light fires, but...
Salut, %s!
Been in a tussle recently, %s?
I've burned my bridges with that one.
You can rely on %s when it's important.
Would a nice bowl of hot soup help?
She was bound to start a fire sometime.
Salut, %s!
%s's fists are weapons.
What a heinous act you've committed.
%s is very strong indeed.
Don't be scared, mon amie. I will help.
Surely he didn't know what he was doing when he set the flames.
Salut, Mademoiselle %s.
Have you been up to mischief, Mademoiselle %s?
She's inflicted her grief upon others. Abominable.
I'll cook her favorite dish for supper tonight.
Oh non, non, non. Let's get you fixed up.
You know better than to set flames, Mademoiselle %s.
Bonjour, my metal friend!
%s seems to be on the fritz today.
%s did something truly vile.
%s did a kind thing today.
Excusez-moi? How is it possible they have a ghost?
Fire WillowFirestarter- 
They overheated, perhaps?
Bonjour, Mme. %s!
I thought you were more responsible that that, Mme. %s.
Mme. %s has done an unthinkable deed.
Mme. %s is a reliable sort.
It's not your time to go quite yet, Mme. %s.
I assume she meant it to be a controlled burn.
Bonjour, %s!
I don't trust him with that axe right now.
%s did something unforgivable.
%s has a soft spot a mile wide.
Would some comfort food help?
What on earth have you been eating?
My friends are very strange.
That truly is a powerful curse.
Don't worry mon ami, I'll get you back on your feet... er, hooves?
Goodness, are you feeling alright?
Looks like your goose is cooked, mon ami.
I thought you disliked forest fires?
Bonjour, %s!
I didn't expect him to be the violent sort.
What a terrible act you've committed.
I love your act, by the way.
Is there a medic on this island?
Watch where you light those fires, %s.
Salut, %s.
%s has been irritable lately.
I may not have it in me to forgive %s.
%s isn't bad, just a little crunchy on the outside.
That looks very uncomfortable.
Let's not trust %s with flammable things for now.
Bonjour, %s!
I fear %s more than anyone here.
%s has done something truly abominable.
%s is a great ally, indeed.
I'm surprised I outlived %s, frankly.
%s's fires burn as wildly as her passions.
Salut, petit monsieur %s.
What have you been up to, petit monsieur?
What a terrible creature.
I should make him a little treat later.
Oh, you poor thing.
Fire is dangerous you know, petit monsieur.
Bonjour, %s!
You've been much too rough lately, %s.
She's done a truly awful thing.
I admire %s's sense of duty.
Let's fix you up, alright?
%s started quite the fire recently.
Salut, my fuzzy red friend!
I don't find %s's pranks very funny.
%s did something very, very cruel.
%s is a trickster, but he helps sometimes too.
I don't think it bothers him as much as it does mortals.
It makes sense that he'd like fire.
Bonjour, %s!
You won't make friends that way, %s.
I could never be friends with such a creature.
%s is a kind little veg.
Hold on, mon amie, I will find a heart.
Fire isn't safe for you, %s.
Heh. Bonjour, mon a-ME.
%s, why fight when we can cook?
Mon dieu! I'm a monster!
It's quite nice to have myself around.
I cook so I don't have to think about my own mortality.
Mon dieu! Watch the fire!
Salut, mademoiselle %s!
That wasn't very nice, %s!
Mon dieu! What a horrible little creature!
You are very kind, little one.
Don't you worry, we'll get this sorted out!
Ah-! Little ones shouldn't play with matches!
Bonjour, %s!
Let's all calm down with a nice bowl of soup.
Mon dieu! You're a murderer!
You've been a big help, %s.
Oh my. Does that hurt?
I don't want to nitpick how you light fires, but...
Nature's perfect food.
Could use a few different herbs...
I must remember to cut across the grain.
Could use a chimichurri sauce...
Could use chipotle...
Fresh protein!
Could use sea salt...
Could use a teriyaki glaze...
Hmmm, nice marbling...
Could use... uh... I don't even...
Could use... better judgment...
Meaty leaves? I'm so confused...
Could use less oxymorons...
Dark meat!
Could use a light honey garlic glaze...
Poisson!
Could use a squeeze of lemon...
Anguille.
Could use some Cajun spices...
This meat has a gamey odor.
Not the finest cut of meat.
Could use... Hm... I'm stumped...
I am hopping with excitement!
Could use garlic and clarified butter...
Hmmm, maybe a soup stock of batwings?
Needs garlic...
Don't worry, mon amie. I will make you delicious.
The grand poisson!
Catch of today!
Oh its petit face.
Could use sesame oil and chilis...
No sense letting it go to waste.
You can really taste the 'rainbow'.
Could use garlic...
Doesn't even smell fishy it's so fresh!
Tuna, packed in oil!
Could use fresh herbs and butter...
I will honor this ingredient.
They have a salty aroma.
Smooth, salty, scrumptious.
Into my tummy you go! Good bi, valves.
Could use shallots and lemongrass...
I can make caviar with canapes!
Could use a squeeze of fresh lemon.
Would you prefer to be scorched, or cracked?
Sigh. It's not even seasoned.
How would you like to be a nice chowder?
Ah, I should have saved the head for soup!
It couldn't be any fresher!
Pan-fried grouper with pigeon peas! Delectable!
This looks rather bland.
One step closer to my mouth.
Could use garlic-butter...
That can't possibly be edible.
It is lifeless, yet surprisingly hot to touch.
It be best to cook these before eating.
Should I risk eating these now?
Pre-shelled escargot!
Not so great without garlic butter.
This will barely do as an appetizer!
A tasty little morsel!
Small, but surely delicious with the right accoutrements!
I do wish I had bigger fish to fry.
Has this fish already been cooked?
I've worked with worse looking ingredients.
You will make a fine fish dinner!
Hm, I wonder if those spines are poisonous.
Ah yes, with a squeeze of lemon, some pepper...
Ah, some butter, some salt, and you'll be scrumptious!
Fresh fruit!
Could use a pinch of sugar.
Just the flavor I needed!
Could use some oats and a few chocolate chips...
So exotic!
Could use pudding and chia seeds...
That odor...
Could use onions and chili...
Wonderful!
Could use tahini and mint...
Despite its name, it is mostly filled with delicious!
Could use mint and feta...
Just the flavor I needed!
Could use some oats and a few chocolate chips...
Its packaging is tough to open.
Delectable.
Could use curry...
Glorious!
Could use water...

Fresh picked produce!
Corn! Sweet, sweet corn!
I'm the pumpking of the world!
Aubergine!

Could use pie crust and nutmeg...
Could use tomato sauce and Parmesan...
Perhaps I could make a good soup.
Could use cream and salt...
Don't crowd the mushrooms.
Could use butter and chives...
What deliciousness shall you yield?
Could use smoked salt and balsamic vinegar...
Radiates deliciousness.
Hmm, odd.
Hope it doesn't prick going down.
Could use tortillas and melted queso...
Such a pretty flower from such a prickly customer.
Sea produce!
I do not have much experience with this ingredient.
Could use toasted sesame seeds...
Could use Tamari...
Yam-haw!
Starch never tasted so sweet.
Could use touch of curry and creme freche...
Perhaps there's a drink I put this into.
I can add this to something.
Sparrow grass!
Roasted asparagus. What a treat!
Jumping jelly beans!
Ugh. Does not look appetizing.
I should cook something up with this.
A fine delicacy!
Great for clearing the sinuses!
I'm thinking a nice summer salad...
Roasted with a touch of olive oil.
Ah. It is not ripe yet.
Not my best work.
The perfect ripeness.
Something I just whipped up.
Not as fresh, but I imagine the flavor is still good.
Salad of the sea!
This... could be a bit better.
Ah, crispy!
You can't expect me to eat this!
The fruit seems to have softened somewhat.
Cooking really does wonders.
Ah! The smell of fresh garlic!
What can I add this to?
Boasts as many uses as it has layers.
I would prefer to put this to better use.
Finally, I can make my famous hot sauce!
The roasting really brings out the flavors.
Ah, the mighty potato!
Golden brown. Simplicity at its finest.
Mmm... I can smell the sauces already.
A nice light snack.
Runny eggs... crisp bacon... I could die happy now...
Delectable!
Flaky crust, tart filling... heavenly!
Crunchy golden on the outside, flaky and moist inside!
Takes me south of the border!
Simple, sweet, parfait.
Ah, French cuisine!
Invigorating!
Comfort food!
Junk food is my guilty pleasure.
Opa!
What an otherworldly flavor!
I'm having a ball!
Warms my soul!
What a wasted effort...
Mmmmm pockets of palate punching pleasure!
I would not feed this to my enemies. Or would I...
I've outdone myself this time!
A veritable village of vegetables!
Ah, slightly smoky flesh, savory filling!
I hope it never dislodges from my teeth!
I'm getting sleepy just looking at it!
More like umami! Ooooh mommy!
Oh, brunch how I have missed you so!
I am thankful my sous chefs are not around to witness this abomination...
Edible art!
More like Greatamole!
The heat is sweetly beat!
I feel like a kid again!
Spice up my life!
Energy food!
Perhaps not my most complicated dish, but no less tasty.
Utterly divine!
Classic Japanese fusion!
Truly what I live for!
Magnifique!
Hmmm... An interesting flavor.
I've truly outdone myself!
Being stranded is no reason not to eat well!
Incredible! Just like Nana used to make!
I used Nana's secret recipe.
Mwah! Perfection.
Is this not a thing of beauty?
This is a culinary abomination. I'm appalled.
The artistry in this dish lifts my spirits.
Food that feeds the soul and nourishes the body.
Eat it with a clamshell or the flavor will be ruined.
Such a decadent dish!
Ah, a special dish.
I've had to improvise.
A little chewier than I normally like.
I make do with the ingredients at hand.
Ah. Refreshing.
Food with medicinal properties.
A slight variation on a cherished recipe.
Add a little spice.
Tastes like fast food.
Tea! Oh how I missed you!
A little something sweet to brighten the day.
Bone appétit!
A hint of spice to awaken the tastebuds.
I think I've outdone myself, given the available ingredients.
Ah. Perfect on a hot day.
My own special recipe!
The secret is to use a whole stick of butter.
I'm quite proud of how it turned out.
It's really not as scary as it sounds.
I like to make my dishes pop!
It came out just right.
Junk food can be as enjoyable as anything gourmet.
I like to spice things up!
I ground the horns up myself.
You may grow up to be delicious one day.
Future carrots!
The promise of so many more corn dishes!
They hatch dragonfruits.
Even these smell...
Hatches more eggplants!
Seedy seeds!
Seed saver!
Could use smoked paprika...
Nectar of the gods!
I wonder what dishes I could create with these?
I thought I would never see you again, old friend!
It is a sin to waste food...
Pee-eew!
Ugh. Not food safe!
This could use something... Anything.
Can I make this into cheese?
More watermelon, anyone?
This lard would feed a hungry fire!
Are these truly brain bits?
People often confuse yams and sweet potatoes. They're very different!
These might be good in a salad.

Fire burns within.
Such a cool blue.

Ahh, a rare attraction!
I miss oranges...
Disgusting.
The end result of a fine meal.
Poop of the bat.
Someone must have really lost their marbles.
I'll hum my own tune.
Some things can't be undone.

Man-made masticators.

Too much power to hold in one hand.

Fascinating.

Golden ham, golden honey, golden coin.
Like icecubes.
I wonder if it is a menu?
Such a shame...
Why can't you be olive oil?
Time to catch myself some dinner.
That's one giant fork!
Why on earth do I have this?
I can't pair this with anything.
Do they work with paring knives?
I prefer the lute, myself.
This has no business calling itself a plate.
I should be careful with this.
An odd prescription.
Perfect for a candlelit dinner!
What an interesting contraption.
Fancy.
I wouldn't wear this even if it was my size.
It looks expectant.
I'm afraid I won't fit.
Not much of a candle then, is it?
Sea-what?
Some sort of menacing key.
Finally, the recognition I deserve. Does it get any bigger?
I can purchase fresh groceries with this.
Only the finest to eat tonight!
Mon dieu! Think of the groceries this could buy!
Like a lobster cracker, but for a city.
What strange textures.
An odd little fellow.
I bet it picks up all sorts of aromas.
This would make a pretty centerpiece.
If only it were a real truffle.
I always wanted to learn another language.
Metal cooked well done.
Completely inedible.
I'm out to forage!
I'll only need the kitchen.
I don't think I'm cut out for royalty.
It must unlock something.
I shall make a whole city of delicatessen!
A centerpiece?
Perhaps it can be used as a placemat.
Is this really so precious?
I don't think it's edible.
Something's stirring inside.
I think it's waking up.
I get the feeling something will happen soon.
I don't think it's my place to be holding this.
What now, Mademoiselle Wendy?
Bonjour, mademoiselle.
It's been left completely breathless.
How colorful!
Maman used to keep a journal, before her memory went.
This one looks complicated.
Plush and soft, if a bit dirty.
Oh! I could sculpt something based off this.
Ah, it looks like a recipe for some fishing tackle.
This seems very precious.
That beef heart is almost certainly past its prime.

This is not the place for it.
I'm not quite ready yet.
I'll need to get a little closer to cook with that.
Not a shaveable beast.
Nothing to shave.
It would be unwise to attempt this while the animal is awake.

Beefalo in combat, unable to mount- 
Mon dieu. It's busy just now.
It's too angry to do that.
Mon dieu, that's far away.
Magnifique!
That was past its best-by date...
Blech! Why did I allow that to cross my lips?
Aarg! My stomach...
Delectable!
Tres magnifique!
Not very palatable.
A bit dry.
Blech. Completely lacking in every way.
I'd prefer some variety.
So bland.
I want to eat something different.
I can't stand this food.
Enough already!
I need food...
Darn!
Come back, light!
Aha! Now that is using my head!
Gah!
I believe I could repair that.
Not a comforting sound...
That was much too close!
I'm baking like a souffle...
I am thankful for this tree's protective buffer.
I've been lightly spritzed.
I am getting positively drenched.
I fear I may be water soluble!
I'm wetter than a dish rag!
Everything is slicked...
I fear that that is about to cook itself.
Charred...
I do not like that sound one bit!
Sleep in a burning bed? I think not.
Not a comforting sound...
Incoming!
I do believe they wish me harm.
I recognize that sound. Hunger.
I do not like that sound one bit!
The implications of this are murky.
Oh dear me, I have reached the point of no return.
I have emerged from the edge of the world.
Whoaaaa!
The vessel is damaged...
Oh no... I can't die on an empty stomach!
Into the soup!
The net is full!
I was going to make you into a beautiful dinner!
This seems to point to points unknown.
Oh. Can't buy that.
I can't afford that.
Perhaps there is a way to unlock it.
I don't recognize this place.
Hack! Cough! Smells like gas!

Hay Fever starting- 
Ugh! My allergies!
I think... my nose has cleared!
Eat your heart out!
Atchoum!
Agh! Bats!
I already have a little companion.
The terrible monsters are back!
Oh, it's venisON!
oOooOooo!!
My poor sirloin's not looking so good!
Oh. It must belong to someone else.
Mon dieu! She is sinking!
I don't want to be brined!

PeekhenPeep Hen (dead)- 

SnapdragonSnapdragon- 
Goodness! You are large.
Shhh.
Alas, even its roots are inedible.
You look like you have a lot of meat, my friend.
Am I desperate enough for horse meat?
I'll not kick a dead horse.
I would not recommend this.
Mmm, meat popsicle!
I wish I could grill a salmon on this.
Would not want to brush up against you.
The start of a good cook fire.
Tool fuel.
The meat slumbers...
It calms my mind to watch you flutter.
Could use herbs...
Meat leaves? I'm so confused...
Could use a honey garlic glaze...
Could use some cajun spices...
I'm hopping with excitement!
Hmmm a stock made from batwings?
I wonder what dish I could create with these?
Warmer, warmer...
Aggressions spoils the meat.
Move faster than you'd think.
I will butcher you!
I will not yield!
Darkness...
Light brings another day.
C-C-Cold!
Magnifique!
How do you dig your new surroundings?
I am thankful for the protective embrace of this tree.
I would never leave home without it!
Mail after a fashion.
Good day!
So long.
I could certainly use it.
How am I going to eat with this thing?
Better than swimming I suppose. If I could swim.
How wild can they be if they live in houses?
In time, more will sprout.
The mussels will stick to this and I shall stick it to them!
There's nothing edible left inside.
This fat would feed a hungry fire!
The promise of another yam harvest!
Long-range kebab-ing.
It would make me sick to use this on good meat.
Ready. Aim. Fire.
Such an amiable creature. Perhaps we could be friends?
With some good grazing, you will fatten up nicely.
A banana in a cave, I've seen it all now.
Could use oats and chocolate chips...
Say again?
My situation appears very grim...
Oar really?
Oarn't you glad I didn't say banana?
A trusty companion in these environs.
A golden chopper!
I'm not the landscaping type.
Shiny.
For those tough to crack nuts.
That looks nice.
If only I had aftershave.
For tenderizing boeuf!
Proper farm gear.
Lighter than my meringue.
For tidying unkempt beast hair.
Let's see if I can ride on this.
Durable.
Adds a little spice to my ride.
It's like a spatula for a saddle.
Too salty.
I could chop a lot of onions with this!
Fancy slicer.
Good for cutting hedges and grass.
A simple way to weigh!
To keep the dark at bay.
To warm my fingers and roast sausages.
The flames climb higher!
Maximum heat!
I should like to sit by you for a moment.
Parfait.
It is getting low.
I should stoke the fires
I shall have to light you again.
I like when it's warm and toasty.
Not much for caramelizing creme brulee, but it will do for seeing.
Aha! Now that is using my head!
Trick 'R neat!
It is my night light.
Fire that cools?
The flames climb higher!
I should like to sit by you for a moment.
It is getting low.
I should stoke the fire.
I shall have to light you again.
Neat vision!
I wonder if this could be converted into a pizza oven?
Shine on!
To warm my fingers and roast sausages.
Maximum heat!
This fire's on fire!
It's getting low.
That fire's almost out!
I like when it's warm and toasty.
What a rustic delight!
Is this a fire hazard, or a boating hazard?
Goodness! It's a grease fire!
It's burning steady.
Looks a bit dim.
Worryingly low.
I can't cook without a fire!
Handy for some nighttime cooking.
Ah, I can see through the eyes of a bat.
Sometimes, you need a break.
I do like being able to see.
Mmm, smells like fried mushrooms.
Sometimes, you need a break.
I like a nice pale blue, personally.
Mmm, smells like fried mushrooms.
This is Willow's.
It has my back.
Cochon bag!
Oh, roast bird... Hm, don't get ahead of yourself, Warly...
For catching alternative protein.
I do prefer the fish market...
A little better than raw ground.
Cozy.
For roughing it.
I do not wish to be so tricky but, the dinner bell calls me.
First aid.
Soothing.
I will try to remember not to open indoors.
North.
South.
East.
West.
Northeast.
Southeast.
Northwest.
Southwest.
Hmm, no reading.
Oh. I believe it broke.
A good food wrap.
There's nothing to wrap.
A cool dry place to keep food.
Now this I can use!
Why is it so big?
Comes in handy after a big lunch.
Siesta in the dark? I think not.
This is no time to close my eyes!
My hunger trumps my exhaustion.
This does not strike me a relaxing place for siesta.

Tent BurntTent (burnt)- 
A good nights sleep up in smoke.
Overcooked.
A temperature stone.
Vanilla ice.
Still cold.
It's warming up nicely.
Hot!
A little shade is better than none.
Thatch you very much.
This will straighten my back out.
Wetter is better.
My bag of chef's tricks!
Like a cool ocean breeze.
Seems like a waste of a good banana. Cute though.
Singing not in the rain!
Could come in very handy.
The great indoors!
This will keep those bugs away from my food.
I can call the little birdies to me!
I don't like that it's still beating.
It's not so bad, if you close your eyes.
A balloon, filled with water? What a funny idea.
Like a cool ocean breeze.
I've been told his name is 
What a silly fellow.
Tres géant!
Poor little fellow.
I can signal mes amis!
Empty pot, empty heart.
A masterpiece takes time.
Nearly there...
Ahh, fini!
That can't go in there.
Home of the honeymakers!
No more honey...
There is some honey.
Honey jackpot!
I can grow my own ingredients!
Ah, couldn't be more fresh!
Fresh-picked produce!
Needs to be fertilized.
Ah the Ice Box, she calms me.
Just like the chefs of the stone age!
Not quite dry enough.
Ready to test on my teeth!
Tragique.
No honey will come from this now...
I wouldn't put any seeds in there.
Now it is more like a rehydrating rack...
Too dry! Too dry!
Sauce for my garden!
Mussels aren't strong enough to resist this stick!
Imagine! Fresh mussels, whenever I desire!
What new culinary adventures shall we undertake, old friend?
I would never leave home without it!
The flavors need time to meld.
I threw that meal together!
Pickup! Oh, old habits...
I'll have to sacrifice caviar ingredients for this.
Just think, market fresh fish every morning!
Should I make a fish stew with thyme and onion?
Oh! Boiled fish with celery and goat pepper?
Maybe a chowder with hot pepper and shrimp stock!
Let the cook off begin!
It garnishes the plants with water.
The ice box, my second-most loyal culinary companion.
I could grow some fresh mushrooms here.
Oh, my mushrooms are beginning to grow!
It's nice not to have to forage for the basics.
My days of wild mushroom hunting are over!
I'll need to find a replacement if I want fresh mushrooms.
Mmm, smells like fried mushrooms.
Mushrooms are out of season right now.
It has greatly improved my culinary adventures.
Fresh spices! Oh, how I have missed you!
Pickup! Oh, old habits...
A centre for learning.
Oh, the things I'll learn!
Splendid. I should like to know when the worm is going to turn.
It measures moisture in the clouds.
I do feel a bit safer now.
Electricity!
Boom!
That didn't cook very well.
The fire seemed to like it.
Foresight is 0/0.
It measures exactly nothing now...
He's sleeping.
Make it snow!
Shall I fuel it up?
Positively charged to get my hands on one!
Couldn't hurt to hit the books now and then.
A small luxury.
Whistle while you work!
It's still running.
Nearly out!
Doesn't smelt as good as bacon frying.
Good ventilation in the kitchen is an must.
It's run dry.
It's tres heavy!
I hope my penmanship is legible.
Oh dear!
Well, that won't help our explorations much.
Just need some stone to get cooking.
Overcooked.
That doesn't seem right.
Ready for the chisel.
I'd have to take the other object out first.
Someone's a very talented artist.
We've learned that already.
All the knowledge of a seasoned seafarer!
It's all gone up in smoke.
I always wished to make a name for myself.
For kebab-ing.
Mmm, ham popsicle!
Oh good, I have separation anxiety.
Ouch! Stupid, horrible thing!
They won't know what hit them.
A sleep aid!
Breathing fire!
Made from pork, to protect my melon.
How much protection can grass provide?
Sturdy, but flammable.
Weighs a ton.
Weaponized bees.
This is not a cruelty-free trap.
Heavy and hot.
I feel electric!
Does nature like being tamed?
Would make me sick to use this on good meat.
A coward's weapon, alas...
Weaponized food.
This will only burn for so long before...
Now we're cooking!
En garde!
Much more waterproof than a chef's hat.
Seashell mail.
With this I will be a stone man.
If I prick enemies half as much as I pricked myself making it, it'll be worth it.
I dislike fighting.
It's light enough.
It still smells of bug.
The pith has been removed.
There's no meat inside.
I prefer a chef hat.
Like an armor made of tin cans.
The meat is more tender if the death is quick.
I don't have the confidence to pull it off like she does.
I'm better with a spatula.
It's positively electric.
I'd rather whip up a nice meringue.
Bonne nuit, everybody.
Not the best looking hat, but c'est la vie.
Suitable lodging for a feathered beast.
I now have an egg farm!
Sleep now, lay later.
Can I blow this down?
Looks like more than 3 little piggies in there.
Yoo hoo! Anybody home?
Do my eyes deceive me?
Hay look, a wall!
Calling it a wall is kind of a stretch.
Turns in a wooden performance as a wall.
Putting down stakes.
I feel secure behind this.
Good stone work.
Treasure!
What's the use in a sign around here?
Nature. Tamed.

Overcooked.
How calming.
It looks at home here.
How wild can they be if they live in houses?
Someone has a hoarding issue.
Citrus-infused walls!
Zesty wall.
I do not like these fellows one bit.
I was hoping it would be full of potatoes.
Helps keep my dry environment dry.
Bonjour!
Looks like a rickety ride to someplace...
A beacon to light my way.
I probably shouldn't keep perishables in it.
They're quite social creatures, no?
I could probably place this at sea without issue.
Good and strong.
Pest control.

Essential honey harvesting attire.

Fashionably refreshing.
Toasty and trendy.
Snacks to go?

Seems unnecessarily fancy.
Ancient armor.
I could tenderize some meat with this.
Wake up!
This is my friend, Lazer Oeil!
These logs might be better suited to a fire...
Better than swimming, I suppose.
Free me from the shackles of this island!
For long distance hauls.
I am comforted by its sea-worthiness.
It's a bit wobbly.

A most sensible traveling companion.
This should speed things up.

EyeplantNature - Plants
Base Game
EvergreenEvergreen- 
A soldier of the exotic forest.
A coneless arbre.
I am ever so glad I'm not a tree hugger.
Sliced!
There, now you cannot prick anyone.
Au revoir, tree.
You will not be missed.
Crisp, no?
The wood gives off a unique aroma when burned.
One day you'll be a tree.
An important aspect of my art.
Soon it won't be good for much.
This, a grill and some meat and I'd have dinner.
Pine-scented!
How supremely unnatural!
Tres suspicious...
Magic building blocks!
Those could be key to my continued survival.
There is nothing left for me to grasp!
Those burn quite nicely.
Shall I bring it back to life?
The start of a good cooking fire.
A common ingredient for success around here.
Plucked clean!
Could I get some fertilizer over here!
I never burn anything in the kitchen.
What shall I craft?
Berries!
More will return.
They require care and fertilizer.
A small clump of reeds.
There's nothing left to take.
The fire took to those quite nicely.
Smells like green.
I wonder if it is edible.

PlantPlant (ready to be picked)- 

Spiky BushSpiky Bush- 
A prickly customer.
Not sure I want to do that again.
It burns like any other bush.
Charmant.
Great in salads.
It even looks crazy!
Not so great in salads.
Ah a fresh carrot!
Can't get fresher than that!
It'll be hard to harvest like that.
There's nothing there.
Little champignon!
Did it eat itself...?
I eagerly await its rebirth!
Ah, a blue truffle!
It retreats from the light.
I hope there is room for more mush...
A bouquet of leaves.
Sliced!
Au revoir, tree.
Crisp, no?
A new beginning...
It could use some love.
Too hot for you.
The heat has stifled these berries.

BirchnutBirchnut- 
It rattles.
I bet it has a sharp flavor.
It will live to prick again.
What secrets do you hold?
A tuft of usefulness.
Gigantesque!
I do wish those were grapevines...
More will sprout in time.
Sliced!
How divine! It has been de-vined.
Au revoir, tree.
A waste.
Crisp, no?
That smoky aroma always makes me hungry...
Shall I bring it back to life?
Now I can put it wherever I want.
Cute, no?
Could be fashioned into chopsticks...
Not a single grape on it...
Herbe at sea.
Chewy rock, with a clever finish.
Sea produce!
I wonder what its water content is?
I'd say its current water content is zero.
A good leaning tree.
Evidence of a coconut uneaten. Sigh.
These would work well in tamales.
Pardon, but are you sleeping?
Inedible.
A bit grotesque.

Rainforest Tree StumpRainforest Tree (stump)- 

Rainforest Tree SickSick Rainforest Tree- 
It's spoiled.
Those strange monkeys must hang out here.
A tiny seed inside.

Tea TreeTea Tree- 
I could to so many things with tea tree leaves.

Tea Tree BurntTea Tree (burnt)- 

Tea Tree StumpTea Tree (stump)- 

Seed PodSeed Pod- 
More useful as medicine than in my recipe.

Tuber TreeTuber Tree- 
I do like tubers.

Tall GrassTall Grass- 
Too long to cut it with my hands.

Exotic FlowerExotic Flower- 
Edible? Perhaps not.
A plant of many uses. And recipes.
I should snatch those up.
What ravishing radishes!
Ah. Smells like eucalyptus.
I do hope it grows back.
The soil is over-cooking it.
Ah, it's keeps moist with a marinade.
I'll find somewhere to plant this.
Watch those thorns!
It would make a beautiful centerpiece.
How eerie.
What a marvel.
Mmm, lotus root...
I doubt it has much flavor.
I can think of plenty of uses for those.
How charming!
It's a hedge.
I could shave it like a carrot.

Hedge (burnt)- 

Intricate Topiary- 
Very impressive.
It looks hungry.
A barbeque spit.
Pity there are no berries on it.
A fine stick.
Strange place for a tree.
Mon dieu!
Just a petite bébé.
What a shame.
It's a tree made of kabob sticks.
No more for now.
It, oh, it appears to be on fire.
Crisp, no?
That tree looks like it's on its way out.
Just a petite bébé.
It will grow into a fine tree.
It's coming down with something.
It's starting to look a little funny.
I think it's coming down with a little something.
Would some nice soup make you feel better?
It's under the weather.
It's got food poisoning.
Berries!
I can't wait for more.
It's burning down!
No more fresh berries for my desserts.
Now I can have fresh berries wherever I please!
It's much too hot, I agree.
Just a petite marble bébé.
If marble beans can grow, maybe they can be eaten.
Confections flavored with rose water, perhaps?
What an adorable little plant.
I wonder if I can find some culinary use for this.
Salad of the sea!
She needs time to regrow, non?
Perhaps it'll grow if I plant it.
This tree's spent too much time at sea.
All nicely chopped.
Driftwood en flambé!
Charred to a crisp.
It's surprisingly light.
What a strange looking tree.
Nothing but a stump left.
It's on fire!
Quel dommage.
How lovely!
Grow big and strong, little tree!
What a strange looking shrub!
I must be patient.
It's all out of fruit.
It's withered from the heat.
I think something's wrong with it.
That doesn't look healthy.
Did I leave the stove on?
Let's find somewhere to plant this.
I can hear the activity within.
Not your average bees.
Just add milk!
It smells wet.
Hmm, soup stock...
Looks like some sort of ritual stone.
It's tugging on my mind.
Do not lick it. Your tongue will get stuck.
And I'm in!
The darkness lurks within.
Headless harps-men.
I wonder how many counter tops I could get out of this...
Would make a nice counter top.
Fisher folk live here. I can smell it.
Its odor is not improving with time...
Ooh la la the things I could do with you!
I wonder what it means?
Made of strong stuff!
Don't you go rolling off me.
Bite-sized boulders.
Sharp as can be!
How curious.
Yolk yellow glowing gold!
I cannot help wondering what might be down there besides...
What have I become?
It's making a bit of a mess, isn't it?
These tracks point to fresh game.
I have lost the trail...
Game is close at hand...
It leads somewhere. And that is what I'm afraid of.
It requires something additional.
It denies my access.
Where we shall go, thing?
One ring to teleport them all!
Definitely for a cranking action for some kind.
This likely connect to a that.
This I do not even...
Am I really doing this?
That is no ordinary tooth-lined hole in the ground!
I must be unhinged to travel so...
I can't see the bottom...
I have a bone to pick with you.
A spider has to live somewhere, I suppose.
This is probably a delicacy somewhere.
Thump twice if you are fat and juicy.
Some outdoorsy types made this.
Yes, vacancy.
Hey fella, need a wing?
Where did he go?
Could be a piece of the ship...
That's ice.
Brr!
It's just liquid now.
The trail is washed out...
It is a nice hill, but I won't make a mountain of it.
What a pity rabbit season has ended.
That fire got the smell out.
I think it needs to burned again! Pee-eew!
Not even the cheeks are left...
How many critters can fit in there?
Vacant of critters.
Must have been a pretty important... thingy...
Ooops...
I have a bone to pick with... m-me?
Yikes! That boat had baaaad luck.
Come out, come out!
Fisherfolk live here. I can smell it.
That fire got the smell out.
Shining, sparkling snacks.
I am waiting for you!
A rainbow sea rock.
What shall I make with you?
Bonjour, mon petit amie.
A petit snail farm!
I have a soft spot for bivalves!
This rocks.
Watch that flame!
Please have fresh underwear inside!
The sand has formed a small pile.
Lots of tiny stones.
That seems like something I should steer clear of.
A pile of sand like any other.
Oh, this gets better and better...
What use is an egg that you cannot eat?
What the deuce?
The beast has slipped by me!
How can I track anything in this deluge!
The beast is close.
I think there's tar down there.
Adds a truly unique flavor to licorice.
The slowed pace gives you time to enjoy the scenery.
It traps snacks.
Spicy!
A delightful seafood dinner dwells there.
Stick with me, mussels. I'll take you places!
Maybe I'll win something tasty?
Shouldn't I boat away from these?
Any cold drinks in there?
This leaves a bad taste in my mouth...
I hope a rations shipment lies within.
Is someone making a gourmet jerky?
What a pretty shell.
I smell trouble...
Skull and cross bones is bad, yes?
What shall I find?
Your hair needs a brushing.
Let's open her up.
It sails no more.
It leads somewhere. And that is what I am afraid of.
Definitely for a cranking action of some kind.
'This' likely connects to a 'that.'
This, I do not even...
One ring to teleport them all!
There may be some protein under there.

Dung PileDung Pile- 
The smell is so strong I can taste it.
Non.
Any eggs in there?
I hope he stays asleep.
I'm staying away from that guy.
Not sure those ribs are good for BBQing.
Could I serve it up with roast potatoes?
I wonder what I could cook up with this.
It's been seasoned with gold.
Perhaps that nosey fellow would like to eat this.
I'd rather have a mound of chocolate.
Mining is a dangerous job.
I've found it!
Not the best place to hide, I think.

Mant HillMant Hill- 
I could take a peek inside.
A fine place for a light.
I suppose pigs lived here once.
A sturdy enough wall.
Locally sourced water, free of impurities.

Ominous Carving-

Not very hearty.

Not working.
'Allo?
Is anyone else coming for dinner?
That's almost definitely bigger than before.
I don't think that honey would taste very good.
I don't remember this being here.
Parts of it look like they were sculpted.
Some old, worn stone.
What an odd shape for a rock.
Where is your nose?
It looks incomplete.
It's looking for its missing piece.
That looks nice.
It looks much better.
Well, it's fixed now.
I think... it's stirring!
That looks a little toasty.
Looks like a rock to me.
A kitchen mishap, maybe?
She seems regal.
Well, as they say, if it ain't baroque!
A lovely marble statue.
It has a very peaceful energy.
A little piece of sky to hold in my hand.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
It seems dangerous, but it's oddly calming.
My mechanical friend seems intent on fixing it.
What goes in the middle, I wonder?
I thought something would have happened.
That looks ripe for the taking.
I think it wants something else.
I think it's breakable.
Did someone sculpt that?
I could use a friend in this difficult world.
Poor %s was overcome by %s.
Oh, what a nice table setting.
I've got to hand it to you, I was startled!
That doesn't look like a natural rock.
Looks like it came off a sculpture somewhere.
I think it was part of a statue.
It won't begin to move, will it?
I feel strangely uneasy.
There might be all sorts of treats inside.
I could use a little break.
I'm sure I'm strong enough to move it.
I can't get at it.
That's an unusual looking starfish.
Don't take a bite out of me!
Ha! I'm nobody's snack!
You know how to get me home to maman?
Nearly there, mon ami!
Hm? Where would you like to go, mon ami?
Oui, I'll take you back where you belong.
Of course I can take you home.
It's giving me goosebumps.
It looks like it goes down forever.
Ah, if only I had time for a nice soak.
What a nice aroma.
It looks quite pretty in the moonlight, non?
An empty basin.
There's something inside that wants out.
That's quite a bit of glass.
My, that's sharp!
Hmm... that might be good in a soup.
A big lumpy rock.
Something is different about that spider den...

Surely mushrooms do not grow on trees here?
Oh, divine tree of mushrooms--what else can you teach me?
Ah, a light in the dark.
Looks like candy.
I always get you upside down with stalactites...
Rocks to be had.
I have no reason to investigate any further.
Yuck!
An absolute madhouse.
How does anything grow down here?
Feuillage.
There must be monkeys close by...

Coffee to go!
A big prickly pickle.
Sword plant!
The pickle will fruit again.
Shall I bring it back to life?

It accepts offerings, I think.

Safe at last.

Unimportant Pillar-

This water is not food safe.

Full of those ant guys.
A honey maker!
Can I harvest any honey from that?
Mant omelet, perhaps?
There are many cherries hidden in that fruit salad.
I wonder what the kitchen is like.
Like fine wine, it is to be admired behind glass.
Now you stay put!
Ah non! She is in pieces!
I should do something about that.
An important ingredient for any sailboat.
That doesn't look safe.
I'll steer us in the right direction!

Oh, I don't like you one bit!
Feels warm.

Bonjour, %s!
Let's all calm down with a nice bowl of soup.
Mon dieu! You're a murderer!
You've been a big help, %s.
Oh my. Does that hurt?
I don't want to nitpick how you light fires, but...
Salut, %s!
Been in a tussle recently, %s?
I've burned my bridges with that one.
You can rely on %s when it's important.
Would a nice bowl of hot soup help?
She was bound to start a fire sometime.
Salut, %s!
%s's fists are weapons.
What a heinous act you've committed.
%s is very strong indeed.
Don't be scared, mon amie. I will help.
Surely he didn't know what he was doing when he set the flames.
Salut, Mademoiselle %s.
Have you been up to mischief, Mademoiselle %s?
She's inflicted her grief upon others. Abominable.
I'll cook her favorite dish for supper tonight.
Oh non, non, non. Let's get you fixed up.
You know better than to set flames, Mademoiselle %s.
Bonjour, my metal friend!
%s seems to be on the fritz today.
%s did something truly vile.
%s did a kind thing today.
Excusez-moi? How is it possible they have a ghost?
Fire WillowFirestarter- 
They overheated, perhaps?
Bonjour, Mme. %s!
I thought you were more responsible that that, Mme. %s.
Mme. %s has done an unthinkable deed.
Mme. %s is a reliable sort.
It's not your time to go quite yet, Mme. %s.
I assume she meant it to be a controlled burn.
Bonjour, %s!
I don't trust him with that axe right now.
%s did something unforgivable.
%s has a soft spot a mile wide.
Would some comfort food help?
What on earth have you been eating?
My friends are very strange.
That truly is a powerful curse.
Don't worry mon ami, I'll get you back on your feet... er, hooves?
Goodness, are you feeling alright?
Looks like your goose is cooked, mon ami.
I thought you disliked forest fires?
Bonjour, %s!
I didn't expect him to be the violent sort.
What a terrible act you've committed.
I love your act, by the way.
Is there a medic on this island?
Watch where you light those fires, %s.
Salut, %s.
%s has been irritable lately.
I may not have it in me to forgive %s.
%s isn't bad, just a little crunchy on the outside.
That looks very uncomfortable.
Let's not trust %s with flammable things for now.
Bonjour, %s!
I fear %s more than anyone here.
%s has done something truly abominable.
%s is a great ally, indeed.
I'm surprised I outlived %s, frankly.
%s's fires burn as wildly as her passions.
Salut, petit monsieur %s.
What have you been up to, petit monsieur?
What a terrible creature.
I should make him a little treat later.
Oh, you poor thing.
Fire is dangerous you know, petit monsieur.
Bonjour, %s!
You've been much too rough lately, %s.
She's done a truly awful thing.
I admire %s's sense of duty.
Let's fix you up, alright?
%s started quite the fire recently.
Salut, my fuzzy red friend!
I don't find %s's pranks very funny.
%s did something very, very cruel.
%s is a trickster, but he helps sometimes too.
I don't think it bothers him as much as it does mortals.
It makes sense that he'd like fire.
Bonjour, %s!
You won't make friends that way, %s.
I could never be friends with such a creature.

Hold on, mon amie, I will find a heart.
Fire isn't safe for you, %s.

Mon dieu! I'm a monster!
It's quite nice to have myself around.
I cook so I don't have to think about my own mortality.
Mon dieu! Watch the fire!
Salut, mademoiselle %s!
That wasn't very nice, %s!
Mon dieu! What a horrible little creature!
You are very kind, little one.
Don't you worry, we'll get this sorted out!
Ah-! Little ones shouldn't play with matches!
Bonjour, %s!
Let's all calm down with a nice bowl of soup.
Mon dieu! You're a murderer!
You've been a big help, %s.
Oh my. Does that hurt?
I don't want to nitpick how you light fires, but...
Nature's perfect food.
Could use a few different herbs...
I must remember to cut across the grain.
Could use a chimichurri sauce...
Could use chipotle...
Fresh protein!
Could use sea salt...
Could use a teriyaki glaze...
Hmmm, nice marbling...
Could use... uh... I don't even...
Could use... better judgment...
Meaty leaves? I'm so confused...
Could use less oxymorons...
Dark meat!
Could use a light honey garlic glaze...
Poisson!
Could use a squeeze of lemon...
Anguille.
Could use some Cajun spices...
This meat has a gamey odor.
Not the finest cut of meat.
Could use... Hm... I'm stumped...
I am hopping with excitement!
Could use garlic and clarified butter...
Hmmm, maybe a soup stock of batwings?
Needs garlic...
Don't worry, mon amie. I will make you delicious.
The grand poisson!
Catch of today!
Oh its petit face.
Could use sesame oil and chilis...
No sense letting it go to waste.
You can really taste the 'rainbow'.
Could use garlic...
Doesn't even smell fishy it's so fresh!
Tuna, packed in oil!
Could use fresh herbs and butter...
I will honor this ingredient.
They have a salty aroma.
Smooth, salty, scrumptious.
Into my tummy you go! Good bi, valves.
Could use shallots and lemongrass...
I can make caviar with canapes!
Could use a squeeze of fresh lemon.
Would you prefer to be scorched, or cracked?
Sigh. It's not even seasoned.
How would you like to be a nice chowder?
Ah, I should have saved the head for soup!
It couldn't be any fresher!
Pan-fried grouper with pigeon peas! Delectable!
This looks rather bland.
One step closer to my mouth.
Could use garlic-butter...
That can't possibly be edible.
It is lifeless, yet surprisingly hot to touch.
It be best to cook these before eating.
Should I risk eating these now?
Pre-shelled escargot!
Not so great without garlic butter.
This will barely do as an appetizer!
A tasty little morsel!
Small, but surely delicious with the right accoutrements!
I do wish I had bigger fish to fry.
Has this fish already been cooked?
I've worked with worse looking ingredients.
You will make a fine fish dinner!
Hm, I wonder if those spines are poisonous.
Ah yes, with a squeeze of lemon, some pepper...
Ah, some butter, some salt, and you'll be scrumptious!
Fresh fruit!
Could use a pinch of sugar.
Just the flavor I needed!
Could use some oats and a few chocolate chips...
So exotic!
Could use pudding and chia seeds...
That odor...
Could use onions and chili...
Wonderful!
Could use tahini and mint...
Despite its name, it is mostly filled with delicious!
Could use mint and feta...
Just the flavor I needed!
Could use some oats and a few chocolate chips...
Its packaging is tough to open.
Delectable.
Could use curry...
Glorious!
Could use water...

Roasted Juicy BerriesRoasted Juicy Berries- 

CarrotFood - Vegetables
Base Game
CarrotCarrot- 
Fresh picked produce!
Corn! Sweet, sweet corn!
I'm the pumpking of the world!
Aubergine!
Could use miso and lardons...
Could use olive oil and cilantro...
Could use pie crust and nutmeg...
Could use tomato sauce and Parmesan...
Perhaps I could make a good soup.
Could use cream and salt...
Don't crowd the mushrooms.
Could use butter and chives...
What deliciousness shall you yield?
Could use smoked salt and balsamic vinegar...
Radiates deliciousness.
Hmm, odd.
Hope it doesn't prick going down.
Could use tortillas and melted queso...
Such a pretty flower from such a prickly customer.
Sea produce!
I do not have much experience with this ingredient.
Could use toasted sesame seeds...
Could use Tamari...
Yam-haw!
Starch never tasted so sweet.
Could use touch of curry and creme freche...
Perhaps there's a drink I put this into.
I can add this to something.
Sparrow grass!
Roasted asparagus. What a treat!
Jumping jelly beans!
Ugh. Does not look appetizing.
I should cook something up with this.
A fine delicacy!
Great for clearing the sinuses!
I'm thinking a nice summer salad...
Roasted with a touch of olive oil.
Ah. It is not ripe yet.
Not my best work.
The perfect ripeness.
Something I just whipped up.
Not as fresh, but I imagine the flavor is still good.
Salad of the sea!
This... could be a bit better.
Ah, crispy!
You can't expect me to eat this!
The fruit seems to have softened somewhat.
Cooking really does wonders.
Ah! The smell of fresh garlic!
What can I add this to?
Boasts as many uses as it has layers.
I would prefer to put this to better use.
Finally, I can make my famous hot sauce!
The roasting really brings out the flavors.
Ah, the mighty potato!
Golden brown. Simplicity at its finest.
Mmm... I can smell the sauces already.
A nice light snack.
Runny eggs... crisp bacon... I could die happy now...
Delectable!
Flaky crust, tart filling... heavenly!
Crunchy golden on the outside, flaky and moist inside!
Takes me south of the border!
Simple, sweet, parfait.
Ah, French cuisine!
Invigorating!
Comfort food!
Junk food is my guilty pleasure.
Opa!
What an otherworldly flavor!
I'm having a ball!
Warms my soul!
What a wasted effort...
Mmmmm pockets of palate punching pleasure!
I would not feed this to my enemies. Or would I...
I've outdone myself this time!
A veritable village of vegetables!
Ah, slightly smoky flesh, savory filling!
I hope it never dislodges from my teeth!
I'm getting sleepy just looking at it!
More like umami! Ooooh mommy!
Oh, brunch how I have missed you so!
I am thankful my sous chefs are not around to witness this abomination...
Edible art!
More like Greatamole!
The heat is sweetly beat!
I feel like a kid again!
Spice up my life!
Energy food!
Perhaps not my most complicated dish, but no less tasty.
Utterly divine!
Classic Japanese fusion!
Truly what I live for!
Magnifique!
Hmmm... An interesting flavor.
I've truly outdone myself!
Being stranded is no reason not to eat well!
Incredible! Just like Nana used to make!
I used Nana's secret recipe.
Mwah! Perfection.
Is this not a thing of beauty?
This is a culinary abomination. I'm appalled.
The artistry in this dish lifts my spirits.
Food that feeds the soul and nourishes the body.
Eat it with a clamshell or the flavor will be ruined.
Such a decadent dish!
Ah, a special dish.
I've had to improvise.
A little chewier than I normally like.
I make do with the ingredients at hand.
Ah. Refreshing.
Food with medicinal properties.
A slight variation on a cherished recipe.
Add a little spice.
Tastes like fast food.
Tea! Oh how I missed you!
A little something sweet to brighten the day.
Bone appétit!
A hint of spice to awaken the tastebuds.
I think I've outdone myself, given the available ingredients.
Ah. Perfect on a hot day.
My own special recipe!
The secret is to use a whole stick of butter.
I'm quite proud of how it turned out.
It's really not as scary as it sounds.
I like to make my dishes pop!
It came out just right.
Junk food can be as enjoyable as anything gourmet.
I like to spice things up!
I ground the horns up myself.
You may grow up to be delicious one day.
Future carrots!
The promise of so many more corn dishes!
They hatch dragonfruits.
Even these smell...
Hatches more eggplants!
Seedy seeds!
Seed saver!
Could use smoked paprika...
Nectar of the gods!
I wonder what dishes I could create with these?
I thought I would never see you again, old friend!
It is a sin to waste food...
Pee-eew!
Ugh. Not food safe!
This could use something... Anything.
Can I make this into cheese?
More watermelon, anyone?
This lard would feed a hungry fire!
Are these truly brain bits?
People often confuse yams and sweet potatoes. They're very different!
These might be good in a salad.

Flytrap StalkFlytrap Stalk- 
Possesses a flavor reminiscent of artichoke hearts.
The ingredients for honey making.
The water of life.
Ah, a fine addition to any garden.
This will grow some nice fresh vegetables.
Nice fresh vegetables for a salad.
These will grow some nice fresh vegetables.
I feel inspired to try my hand at confections!
What fresh ingredients will grow from these?
What fresh ingredients will grow from these?
What fresh ingredients will grow from this?
What fresh ingredients will grow from these?
What fresh ingredients will grow from these?
Schematics!
The insides of those naughty machines.
I miss ash covered cheeses. I miss cheeses, period.
It is no more.
Fire burns within.
Such a cool blue.
I miss lemons...
Ahh, a rare attraction!
I miss oranges...
Disgusting.
The end result of a fine meal.
Poop of the bat.
Someone must have really lost their marbles.
I'll hum my own tune.
Some things can't be undone.
Somewhere a lawn misses you.
A rocketship for ants?
These almost look dangerous.
A distraction of little substance.
Ah, memories of bathing.
Buttons are not so cute.
Man-made masticators.
He doesn't seem trustworthy to me.`
I know no recipe that calls for this.
Too much power to hold in one hand.
Stop staring at me or I'll kick dirt over you!
I could make a hearty stock with these.
Fascinating.
The worst kind of gland!
Golden ham, golden honey, golden coin.
Like icecubes.
I wonder if it is a menu?
Such a shame...
Why can't you be olive oil?
Time to catch myself some dinner.
That's one giant fork!
Why on earth do I have this?
I can't pair this with anything.
Do they work with paring knives?
I prefer the lute, myself.
This has no business calling itself a plate.
I should be careful with this.
An odd prescription.
Perfect for a candlelit dinner!
What an interesting contraption.
Fancy.
I wouldn't wear this even if it was my size.
It looks expectant.
I'm afraid I won't fit.
Not much of a candle then, is it?
Sea-what?
Some sort of menacing key.
Finally, the recognition I deserve. Does it get any bigger?
I can purchase fresh groceries with this.
Only the finest to eat tonight!
Mon dieu! Think of the groceries this could buy!
Like a lobster cracker, but for a city.
What strange textures.
An odd little fellow.
I bet it picks up all sorts of aromas.
This would make a pretty centerpiece.
If only it were a real truffle.
I always wanted to learn another language.
Metal cooked well done.
Completely inedible.
I'm out to forage!
I'll only need the kitchen.
I don't think I'm cut out for royalty.
It must unlock something.
I shall make a whole city of delicatessen!
A centerpiece?
Perhaps it can be used as a placemat.
Is this really so precious?
I don't think it's edible.
Something's stirring inside.
I think it's waking up.
I get the feeling something will happen soon.
I don't think it's my place to be holding this.
What now, Mademoiselle Wendy?
Bonjour, mademoiselle.
It's been left completely breathless.
How colorful!
Maman used to keep a journal, before her memory went.
This one looks complicated.
Plush and soft, if a bit dirty.
Oh! I could sculpt something based off this.
Ah, it looks like a recipe for some fishing tackle.
This seems very precious.
That beef heart is almost certainly past its prime.

I shall have to attempt that again.

It is no more.
That looks important.
A finely tuned radar stick.
Hmm, keep looking.
I've caught on something!
Warmer, warmer...!
I can almost smell it!
Is it a chopping block?
How do I turn it on?
Preparation complete!
What fresh devilment is this?
I wonder what is in his record collection?
A light is always welcome.
He is literally made of stone.
I must remember where this is...
Darn!
These things can look worse?
But where is the key?
Heavy is the bum that sits on the throne...
Free him!
She's trapped!
Surely no one deserves such treatment!
I cannot do that.
Freeeeeeee!
I'm... getting freezerburn...
I'm also an accomplished butcher!
You look delicious!
No part of you will go to waste, cochon!
I hope it does not rain after I kill you!
You will die, pest!
There's no shame in running!
Whew. I'm out of breath.
Noooo, those hocks, those chops...
I hope it didn't take any bites out of me.
That could have been worse.
The honeymakers are upon me!
The dinner hour approaches.
Darkness, darkness.
A new day comes with the dawning light.
I cannot see a thing!
I cannot do that.
I am lacking the required ingredients.

Trying to sleep during the day- 
It is too bright to sleep.
I'm not tired.
My hunger trumps my exhaustion.
This is no time to close my eyes!
Goodness, it seems busy.
Oh dear...
It's sleeping.
It requires more manure.
I recognize that sound. Hunger.

Deerclops is coming- 
I do not like that sound one bit!
I cannot carry another stitch.
I cannot right now.
It is too full.
This is not the place for it.
I'm not quite ready yet.
I'll need to get a little closer to cook with that.
Not a shaveable beast.
Nothing to shave.
It would be unwise to attempt this while the animal is awake.

Beefalo in combat, unable to mount- 
Mon dieu. It's busy just now.
It's too angry to do that.
Mon dieu, that's far away.
Magnifique!
That was past its best-by date...
Blech! Why did I allow that to cross my lips?
Aarg! My stomach...
Delectable!
Tres magnifique!
Not very palatable.
A bit dry.
Blech. Completely lacking in every way.
I'd prefer some variety.
So bland.
I want to eat something different.
I can't stand this food.
Enough already!
I need food...
Darn!
Come back, light!
Aha! Now that is using my head!
Gah!
I believe I could repair that.
Not a comforting sound...
That was much too close!
I'm baking like a souffle...
I am thankful for this tree's protective buffer.
I've been lightly spritzed.
I am getting positively drenched.
I fear I may be water soluble!
I'm wetter than a dish rag!
Everything is slicked...
I fear that that is about to cook itself.
Charred...
I do not like that sound one bit!
Sleep in a burning bed? I think not.
Not a comforting sound...
Incoming!
I do believe they wish me harm.
I recognize that sound. Hunger.
I do not like that sound one bit!
The implications of this are murky.
Oh dear me, I have reached the point of no return.
I have emerged from the edge of the world.
Whoaaaa!
The vessel is damaged...
Oh no... I can't die on an empty stomach!
Into the soup!
The net is full!
I was going to make you into a beautiful dinner!
This seems to point to points unknown.
Oh. Can't buy that.
I can't afford that.
Perhaps there is a way to unlock it.
I don't recognize this place.
Hack! Cough! Smells like gas!

Hay Fever starting- 
Ugh! My allergies!
I think... my nose has cleared!

SnapdragonSnapdragon- 
Goodness! You are large.
Shhh.
Alas, even its roots are inedible.
You look like you have a lot of meat, my friend.
Am I desperate enough for horse meat?
I'll not kick a dead horse.
I would not recommend this.
Mmm, meat popsicle!
I wish I could grill a salmon on this.
Would not want to brush up against you.
The start of a good cook fire.
Tool fuel.
The meat slumbers...
It calms my mind to watch you flutter.
Could use herbs...
Meat leaves? I'm so confused...
Could use a honey garlic glaze...
Could use some cajun spices...
I'm hopping with excitement!
Hmmm a stock made from batwings?
I wonder what dish I could create with these?
Warmer, warmer...
Aggressions spoils the meat.
Move faster than you'd think.
I will butcher you!
I will not yield!
Darkness...
Light brings another day.
C-C-Cold!
Magnifique!
How do you dig your new surroundings?
I am thankful for the protective embrace of this tree.
I would never leave home without it!
Mail after a fashion.
Good day!
So long.
I could certainly use it.
How am I going to eat with this thing?
Better than swimming I suppose. If I could swim.
How wild can they be if they live in houses?
In time, more will sprout.
The mussels will stick to this and I shall stick it to them!
There's nothing edible left inside.
This fat would feed a hungry fire!
The promise of another yam harvest!
Long-range kebab-ing.
It would make me sick to use this on good meat.
Ready. Aim. Fire.
Such an amiable creature. Perhaps we could be friends?
With some good grazing, you will fatten up nicely.
A banana in a cave, I've seen it all now.
Could use oats and chocolate chips...
Say again?
My situation appears very grim...
Oar really?
Oarn't you glad I didn't say banana?
I never was the 'woodsy' type.
A shiny way to cut stuff down.
Time to get digging.
A little too snazzy for my taste.
Not my preferred kind of manual labor.
A shiny way to smash up rocks.
Never hurts to have more tools.
And I know how to use it!
It's so...rural.
I've got ugly handwriting.
Repetitive tasks are soothing.
How'd I get saddled with this? Ha!
Alright, who wants to fight?
Still wouldn't keep up with a Leapin' Lena...
Takes a saddle off real quick.
Keeps livestock nice and docile.
What a handy doo-hickey!
It'll last me the night, hopefully.
It's the pits out here.
A good healthy blaze.
Properly roaring.
About as cozy as it gets out here.
It's gonna go out soon.
On its last legs.
My sister was afraid of the dark.
There's beauty in a simple design.
I put that behind me.
It's childish, but in a nice way.
Who'd want a non-electric lamp?
It's... cold? Somehow?
It makes cold fire? I don't quite get it.
A good healthy blaze.
Properly roaring.
Seems good for now.
Gonna go out soon.
On its last legs.
That's that.
My sister was afraid of the dark.
A real strange contraption.
Where's the plug?
How's it work without circuitry?
Is there an 'on' switch?
It lights up, even without filament.
Roasted.
Neat little gizmo there.
I don't mind playing pack mule.
Makes everything smell like pig.
Birds of a feather get trapped together.
Wish we had mosquito netting.
Not a bad way to unwind.
Gonna hit the hay. Literally.
Better to hit the fur than the hay.
Putting the tent together is the best part of camping.
All the trappings of a good dinner. Ha!
Takes care of workplace injuries.
Soothes minor cuts and scrapes.
It serves its purpose.
South.
North.
West.
East.
Southwest.
Northwest.
Southeast.
Northeast.
I'm pretty good with directions.
We could wrap stuff up for later.
I can't wrap up thin air.
That oughta keep everything nice and fresh.
Keeps drinks cool until breaktime.
Too fancy.
What sort of bonehead sleeps during the day?!
I'd rather sleep then nap.
It ain't safe.
Not without supper first.
No way I'm falling asleep here.
Yup. Just like camping.
Probably for the best. Back to work!
This is a good rock. A special rock.
Brr! Like a chunk of ice.
It's a little chilly.
Tepid.
Almost TOO hot.
Better than nothing.
I got heart to spare.
I've never taken a sick day in my life.
I throw a killer curveball.
Swirly.
Safety in numbers, hey?
This little guy's been well loved.
Is he clockwork? Can I peek inside?
That girl knows how to put on a show.
He's a bit of a fixer-upper.
Say, this is some fine bit of engineering!
I make a mean stew.
The fire still has quite a bit of work to do.
Almost!
Soup's on!
That's quite impractical.
It's like an assembly line in there. Busy!
Where's that stellar work ethic, bees?!
You've been working hard.
Excellent work, bees!
You reap whatcha sow.
Our hard work is paying off.
Good to go.
It needs a bit of a kick.
It's not factory standard.
A rack for drying meat.
It's well on its way.
Ready for eatin'.
You guys like gristle, right?
Factory fire!
I hate seeing hard work wasted.
Not gonna make progress like that.
Well, it's dry.
Plants can't get enough.
Nothing yet.
We've got our first mushrooms!
Looks like a pretty good yield.
Lookit all that fungus.
Not much use with a dead log.
All burned up.
It's real cold out.
A fancy pot for some fancy cookin'.
Let's see if all that fuss was worth it.
I like the way that machine dances.
Probably a whole lot of interesting gears in there.
Well worth all that the work.
Rickety, but I can use it to build things.
I guess proximity activates the whirlygigs?
Assembling gadgets is so fulfilling.
That's a mighty fine gadget.
That's one way to get electricity.
All charged up and nowhere to go.
For when you need a big KABOOM!
Can I make the next one?
Now we get to make another!
Rest in peace, sweet gizmo.
Must fire take everything I love?
We should mass produce these things.
Witness the efficiency of the future!
Needs a top up.
A thing of beauty.
Good place to kick your feet up, if nothin' else.
Welp.
It's okay. I'll assemble another.
Not bad for a handmade table.
Let's build another.
That ain't for sculpting.
Ready for sculpting.
No sense wasting materials.
Looks great!
We already got these schematics.
A testament to my achievements. Or lack of them.
So crude.
Good fer a smackin'.
It's great at comebacks. Ha!
I'll catch you next time! Ow...
Ptoo!
Inflicts the very worst thing... laziness.
Simple, but effective.
Gotta protect the assets.
Not at all useful.
Punch me! It does nothing! Ha!
Protects your inner workings.
Sounds like the hum of an engine.
Gnarly gnashers.
Bit flashy, hey?
No time for star gazin'.
All bluster, no bite.
Surprisingly practical.
This would never pass inspection.
I'm gonna shoot this at the bot's butt.
The preferred tool of the foreman.
An unethical weapon, plain and simple.
Hardhats must be worn beyond this point!
That's some proper metalwork.
She was just a patsy.
Why are you tired? Your life is so cushy.
No way that's up to code.
Fuller than a downtown tenement house.
Hey! I just want some light!
How'd they build these with no thumbs?
Assembly time.
It's just a hay bale, really.
Assembly time.
Built nice and sturdy.
Assembly time.
The building part is over.
Handmade, so you know it's not up to snuff.
I'll take this as a sign.
That's my kind of decor. Simple.
I hate handmade stuff.
What good's a blank sign?
I'm not much of an artist.
Cutesy little drawing.
Just needs to be assembled.
A clearly handmade fence.
Just gotta assemble it now.
A clearly handmade gate.
That's a shame.
Welp.
Guess we should've seen that coming.
Just means we gotta build more.
Hope there was nothin' good inside.
For the snootiest of snoots.
Burnt to cinders.
Hey! Is it my turn to feed the bird?
This poor bird's a bag of bones.
I think it was my turn to feed her.
Let's uh... just sweep that under the rug.
Just waiting for some scribbles.
Burnt to cinders.
Sturdily built.
Pretty sure this one won't move.
I miss lamps.
That's not gonna last much longer.
That bouquet's seen better days.
That's a shame.
Doesn't look too scary.
That lit up real fast!
That happens when you build stuff with straw.
Assembly time.
It's already been built. Sigh.
Pretty fancy for a heater.
I could build a million of these.
And up it goes.
So who wants to build another one?
All a gal needs is a good pair of overalls.
Fire in textiles!
Should I put together another one?
It's in a pot now.
Not bad handiwork.
Yeesh, what a mess.
Whatcha makin' there, kid?
Guess it's back to the drawing board.
An essential building material.
Oh, the possibilities.
Prepped and ready for the assembly line.
I don't have much use for that, personally.
A little snooty gem.
I don't trust that stuff.
It smells kinda alright.
So waxy.
A rock with a hole in it.
That couldn't possibly work.
Now that's some fancy fabric.
Looks just like that egghead! Ha!
Why do we even have that lever?!
Not sure how it works, but I'm gonna find out.
Let's see if I can't play a little ditty.
Creepy to the core.
Soothingly unsettling.
Not too keen on touching that.
I ain't musically inclined.
Ha! Clever.
So tight I barely remember the gnawing hunger!
Now I don't have to take breaks to cool off.
It's, uh, a purple necklace.
Jewelry ain't really my thing.
This 
This doesn't seem safe.
So you're telling me this stick is 
Fully operational.
Still gotta tinker with it a bit.
Ready for a test run!
That ain't coming back to life.
The next one we make'll be better.
Let's make another.
There's always a stampede when the quittin' bell rings.
Someone's got their eye on me.
Must be broke. I can still see the moon.
Brand spanking new moon.
It's waxing.
Full as can be.
It's waning.
It was impractical to build this here.
It runs on 'magic' instead of electricity.
Rarin' to go.
Huh. The craftsmanship ain't half bad.
Does he hafta leave these creepy things lyin' around?
I ain't one for er... decorations.
I don't need thimbles. My hands are pure callus!
I hate cold weather.
Keeps the sun outta your eyes.
Seems secretive.
Respecting bees means respecting stingers.
Well la-dee-da.
Perfect for winters in the tenement house.
How bourgeoisie.
A vest fit for an egghead.
They weren't kidding about the breeze.
I wish it had sleeves.
Just, y'know. Strap a bush on your head.
For getting dolled up.
It's no Tin Lizzie.
Do I look like a fur trader?
A melon for your melon.
There must be a more practical solution.
Very practical.
Dry as a daisy. That's the phrase, right?
Workplace safety is a top priority.
That's one loud shirt.
Nice and dry underneath.
One seriously cozy vest.
I hate fashion.
Helps you see, see?
Really?
I'll stick with my bandana, thanks.
Do I look a little green around the gills? Ha!
I love working with new materials.
Assembly time.
If I break it, I'll get to build it again.
Nothing out of place here.
I feel uneasy for some reason.
The air's all prickly.
It can't possibly get worse.
My head's starting to clear a bit.
I'm feeling much better.
Things seem pretty normal.
For those with a lackluster work ethic.
Useful little tool.
We could be good friends, you and I.
For people who fear good, honest work.
I'm not fully grasping this 'magic' thing.
It's a hard work destroyer.
That's really not my forte.
Transforms the wearer into the 'King of Snoot'.
Not a bad piece of work.
This thulecite stuff is incredible!
Lemme assemble it.
That's a fine piece of work.
There's nothin' on it.
I'm going to spoil you rotten.
Pups love you no matter who you are.
You're just a fluffball on legs!
You're pretty swell, for a tiny monstrosity.
You're pretty cute for a giant bug, hey?
Hey there, feathers.
You sure are fragile, aren'tcha lil fella?
Ugh, don't remind me of food.
It's got bubbles coming out the top.
Nice hat.
Looks heavy.
Why the long face?
I'm not big on headgames.
That ain't supposed to move.
I've got a bad feeling about this one.
It's BUSTed. Ha!
Ha. It looks kinda surprised, don't it?
Y'got a mean mug there, buddy.
It looks like it's hollerin'.
My pals and I can't be beat.
I feel like it's lookin' at me.
I'm fond'a this one.
That statue's moonin' me! HA!
Do I gotta offer it up to something?
Let's get building.
Anything to make gettin' firewood easier.
Ha ha! Just try and fight me!
I'm not really the frou-frou type.
Time to roll up my sleeves!
Remember, back straight, move those arms!
Catch my drift? Ha!
Never know when you might need one.
Someone's gotta assemble this anchor, might as well be me.
I can't wait to build that. I love hoisting things.

Steering Wheel KitSteering Wheel Kit- 
That steering wheel ain't gonna assemble itself.
I was never much of a book learner.
I prefer to learn from experience.
I already know how to sleep, thanks.
I prefer hands-on learning.
I'm not really a 'book smarts' kind of gal.
That's my trusty mending tape.
Not a bad result considering the materials.
Gotta hook it up to the generator.
Quick! Put it out!
Aw, nuts and bolts!
Sorry, Charlie.
Criminy! My machine!
That oughta do it.
Just about out of juice.
Needs some more nitre.
I don't get how gems work, I just know they do.
Gonna need a top up soon.
Needs a few more'a those gem thingies.
Odd design. How do you wear it without pricking yourself?
That lil plant fella whipped it up.
Heh. That bean sprout's a gross little guy.
Hooboy. That's some smelly dust.
Now all I need is some pancakes to pour this over.
Just smelling it is making my eyes water.
I could really go for some potato chips.
It's a goodybag.
A nice change from baked apples.
Is this even food?
Not made of catcoons, thankfully.
Best eaten by the handful.
How spooky.
Curious flavor.
That gummy has too many legs for my taste.
Real gelatinous.
That's no treat.
That's just regular food.
Not sure anyone would eat those.
Ha, yuck! Everyone watch me eat'em!
I ain't patient enough to eat these.
Whew! That's the kick y'need!
Doesn't seem worth fixing.
It's not the real thing.
Someone drank it already.
Chomp chomp.
I wish for more wishes.
It's a plastic creepy crawly.
Hope no one's been snoopin' on us.
That just ain't right - it's left! Ha!
Not sure what to do with it. I'm weighing my options.
Not sure what this was for.
Cute little toy, hey?
Blech. Handmade.
Nope. Can't fix that.
I'm not messing with anymore radios.
That might be fun to take apart.
I can do some experimentin' with that.
Makes ya plucky.
I got lucky and got the big bottle.
Aw, I was hoping for a little more.
Ohh. This'll make a spark.

Totally Normal RootTotally Normal Root- 
Oh hey! There's a little stick in there.
Keep growin' little guy! I'm gonna decorate you.
I should hang this somewhere.
It needs to be in a tree.
Hey, it's them hanging guys.
Ha! Ya almost fooled me.
Time to decorate.
Time for decoratin'!
I'm seein' things!
I got my moxie back. Now to tackle those trees.
I could wrap stuff up real nice.
My presence is a gift. Ha.
Just needs a tree.
Burnt.
Still a bit on the small side.
Now that's a job well done.
Such a shame.
No reason we can't make another.
I love these things!
Just terrible.
No thanks, I'm sweet enough.
Homemade. What a waste of time!
Chocolately.
Not my favorite thing.
That's the good stuff.
Don't burn your mouth.
I know what eggs are, but what's a 'nog'?
Gotta be careful not to break it.
Finally, something with wiring.
Fancy lil ornament.
Reminds me of somthin'.
Look at that fancy pants decoration.
I feel luckier already.
We oughta put a bush in there.
Smells like burnt gobbler.
Seems my fortune's changin'.
I could use a bit of prosperity.
Lucky firecrackers!
Nothing luckier around here than a light.
It's a big fan made of tailfeathers.
Front and center!
It's the beast's tummy!
That's the business end.
I should build something with it!
Needs a little something extra.
Burned right up.
This oughta give them paws pause.
I'll send you runnin', mutt!
How earthy.
You lookin' to scrap, big guy?
I'm glad it ain't movin'.
What a nice drawing.
A good boy if ever I saw one.
It's a sculpture of that mean mutt.
A bunch of things to build.
I gotta find some meat for it.
No good now.
Now that's a feast!
I'll give it to a pig or somethin'.
Somethin' to chew on.
Too big for me to wear.
He's giving me a dirty look.
Chill out, red.
Stand still so I can hit you with a sign.
Swell tattoos you got there.
Nah. I'll wait until morning.
Gotta clean up first.
Nah. It ain't safe for that now.
Why don't you fight us yourself!
Who's ready fer some bacon?!
You keep yer spit to yourself now, buddy.
Steel yourself, turtle.
That acid stuff burns!
He's justa big meathead.
Let's cut him down to size!
Am I supposed to be impressed?
Go back to your cage.
Just like the one I came through...
Welp, time to go!
Can't go home without the key.
Perfect assembly!
Wonder how it works?
Hey! We gotta destroy that Battle Standard!
Can you tell your friends not to get so close to me, kid?
Hey lil fella.
I'm a bit of a Jane-of-all-trades.
Doesn't look too hard to operate.
I ain't much of a bookworm.
I ain't too well read.
I'm most effective with a tool in hand.
Pretty snazzy weapon there!
Check out this drill bit!
I could take a swing at it. Ha!
That'll do the trick.
Efficient, and painful!
That's right up my alley!
Here's fire in yer eye!
It's paper thin!
I'd rather something a bit heftier.
It'll do in a pinch.
That should do the trick.
That armor puts ya at peak efficiency!
This is more my style!
I could really take a hit in that thing!
Can't go wrong with armor.
Gives ya a lil extra punch!
I'm gonna be a real slugger with that thing!
You'd be a real heavy hitter with that.
Faster than tiny hands on an assembly line.
I'd be so efficient with that!
Just some high class trinket.
That'd be fer healin' my pals.
That hat'll help you feel right as rain.
That's fer a bit of self maintenance.
Up'n'attem now.
Back to work!
I'm back on the clock!
That's not really my forte.
Got anything for me?
What's goin' on, squirt?
What'a ya got?
Got anything good?
You're a big guy, hey?
Sleeping on the job.
They don't seem very afraid of people.
Take it easy. You don't looks so good.
You seen one, you seen'em all.
Dead as a doornail.
He ain't a threat to no one.
Nothing in that bush anymore.
Fresh roughage.
Well, they don't LOOK poisonous.
It's just a stump.
I am not a good farmer.
That's gone.
Yeah, we could probably eat that.
It's got a weird texture.
It's a big, pink tree.
That ain't growin' back.
I wish trees leaked a little faster.
That bucket's practically overflowing!
It's a little buggy.
It's lost some of its color.
That stuff can ruin good architecture.
Moss has grown over some sorta socket in the base.
That should keep it busy fer a bit.
I might not be good at rescue missions.
It probably looked real nice once.
I wonder who chiseled that.
Never thought I'd say this, but it's beyond repair.
Well I sure ain't goin' in it now.
It's broken. I can't fix it.
Needs a lot more love than I got to give it.
Looks like something destroyed it.
Even I can't fix it.
I've repaired roofs before but this is a lost cause.
Gives me the heebie jeebies.
Kinda creepy.
Plain shoddy worksmanship.
It might have been a house, once.
Nice metalwork.
Needs a key.
Can't keep me outta nothing.
Ah! A job that could use some elbow grease!
Under-used 'n overgrown.
Woo-wee. Impress-ive.
Zero form, zero function.
Wouldn't mind a peek inside.
My lockpicking skills are a bit rusty.
Anything good in there?
It's full of stuff I could use.
It's a bit salty, hey?
Nice stonework.
That'd be a street lamp. Yep.
That's a light.
Something muddled this clockwork real good.
Oh well. Happens to the best of us.
It's busted.
Ready for assembly.
Needs a pot in there or somethin'.
Welp. Another day, another project.
It's a regular ol' oven.
Now where can I put this...
Big enough for a small cookout.
I need to to find a firepit for this to work.
Time for a cookout!
I only ever made stew before this.
Could make a real big stew in that pot.
For making little stews and stuff.
I'll need to bake it.
Syrup makes me sappy. Ha!
Let's set'er up proper.
It needs a bit more time.
Salt's ready for minin'.
Here lil crabby crab.
I never done farmwork.
Not my kinda tool.
Buckets. The most advanced farming technology.
Hmmm... looks like the key to a safe.
It's a gate key.
Looks like it unlocks somethin' big.
Better than a market.
I got no idea what they'd grow into.
It ain't pink. It's salmon! Ha!
Fancy dining.
I get crabby when I'm hungry. Ha!
It's a big lump of cooked crab.
Cooked roughage.
Wouldn't mind popping these suckers into the pot.

GarlicGarlic- 
Makes everything taste better.
Bet that brought out the flavor.
I hate chopping vegetables.
Done and done.
I just think they're neat.
I've always been a meat and potatoes gal.
Gotta appreciate havin' fresh vegetables.
I prefer'em fried and green.
A fresh, ripe turnip.
I'd rather not eat them on their own.
I go against the grain whenever possible. Ha!
I ain't much of a baker.
I try to support local artisans.
It's a big ol' eatin' rock.
But where's the pepper?
Alright, it's pretty good.
It's no good now.
It's like honey from a tree.
Tastes sorta like... pepper?
That should add some kick.
A lucky coin.
Save this for a rainy day.
Gotta watch I don't turn into a rich dope.
We could bust outta here with enough of these.
Let's throw it up on that altar, hey?
Well this ain't right.
Perfect.
It's the right food, but it don't look too filling.
It's a little toastier than normal.
Little too fancy for my tastes.
Fancy lookin' but it still just holds food.
Can't get in yet.
It's on a dish already.
I always get my dishes mixed up.
Ah, a wonderful bird, the peli-can.
I don't wanna go angering no demons.
There's another key around here somewhere.
Shucks. Someone beat me to it.
The ingredients didn't assemble right.
What a waste of food!
N-nice sky wyrm... Uh-oh.
Better leave while we can!
Just a tree.
Yep. Definitely a tree.
Mhm. It's a tree.
As long as the job's done.
That's one down.
That's an impressive blaze.
Gone up in flames.
Completely charred.
Looks brittle.
It can handle itself from there.
It's a hunk of wood.
I coulda built something with that.
It gets everywhere.
That's a pine cone.
How does that work?
Did that tree just move?
Stop looking at me like that.
Might be useful.
All the useful bits are gone.
Lit up brighter than a New York power grid.
Needs replanting.
Looks like some gardening is in order.
I love getting my hands dirty.
Well it's not gonna replant itself.
I could snap these like twigs! Ha!
That's some tall grass.
It's on break.
Needs a little boost.
Grass fire!
A fire waiting to happen.
Can I eat those?
Not much I can do now.
Picked it right clean.
Needs something from a beast's backside.
Looks like they're hollow inside.
Uh...
Doesn't hold a candle to steel pipe.
A tiny little plant.
It's hard at work.
Good to go.
Gnarly little bush.
Gotta wait a bit.
It's on fire.
A bit cutesy.
Don't see a whole lotta use for these.
I think I'll steer clear of that.
They seem mean-spirited.
Perfectly pluckable.
It's some sorta red mushroom.
It's some sorta green mushroom.
It's some sorta blue mushroom.
Lazy mushroom.
Picked clean. Gotta wait.
It's a mushroom hole.
Got'er done.
Another tree.
Done and done.
That's an impressive blaze.
Completely charred.
Everything you need to build a tree.
This tree's still under construction.
The heat did a number on this one.
It couldn't stand the heat.
You've obviously never worked boiler room.
It's a bit hot out.
Prickly.
Guess we know who won that one.
Rollin' along the road of life.
I don't know how it got here, but good on it.
Right to a crisp.
That's one skinny tree.
Won't have to do that again for awhile.
That's an impressive blaze.
Completely charred.
Looks like that two-bit magician.
Not even worth chopping.
Belongs in the ground.
You're smelling a little funky.
Not lookin' too lush.
Yeuch! Is it supposed to smell like that?
That thing does not look good.
You should see a doctor.
Maybe you oughta take a sick day...
Looks tasty. Hope they're not poison.
Picked it right clean.
Not much I can do now.
Totally pooped. Or unpooped?
I'll replant that if no one else wants to.
Pssh. This heat's nothing.
Uh, it's growing? Maybe?
That came in pretty nicely.
Not sure how to feel about that...
This plant don't give up easy.
It's been picked.
We can pick it if we can get close enough.
The sea's fulla food, hey?
Preferred tool of the foreman.
This tree's seen better days.
Wonder if driftwood's a good buildin' material?
Yeesh, that thing's on fire!
Looks like there was an accident here.
Oof. Kitschy.
Sure is pretty, ain't it?
Don't worry, we'll put it to good use.
The trees sure are pretty 'round here.
It'll be a nice tree someday.
It looks like it's growing rocks!
Ain't got none of them little stone fruits today.
It's done making fruit. Forever.
You look a little down there, bucko.
I think it's coming down with something.
It's definitely diseased.
We could use more fruit bushes I suppose.
Hard at work.
Wouldn't mess with that without good reason.
Let's build a bee house.
So that's where they're comin' from.
It's covered in tooth marks.
Does anyone actually stay dead around here?
I can't begin to imagine how it works.
What on earth is that thing?
I don't know. Some fancy thing.
Fancy.
This marble's real fancy.
I could disassemble that.
I'd better hammer down that eyesore.
I should hammer down that eyesore.
Kitschy.
Great, it's a rock.
Mhm, yep. That's a rock.
A bunch of rocks.
So archaic...
I got some plans in mind for that.
Gold! What a prospect.
Anything good in there, ya think?
Just a hole now.
Time to get my hands dirty.
Something tasty passed through here.
Gah! I lost it.
I didn't order lunch to go. Get'em!
That gadget has my name on it.
Coming along real nice.
Still needs a bit of tinkering.
That did it.
Nice little metal doodad.
Let's get cranky. Ha!
Pulling the lever makes me feel better.
Yuck. Handmade.
I'm not one to shy away from a dirty job.
Here we go!
That'll get the adrenaline pumping!
I can't see the bottom.
A workplace safety reminder.
I'd rather not mess with that.
I think it'd be unwise to plant this.
Lots of excavation work around here.
I wonder how long that took to build?
Just a mud pit.
Chilly.
A weirdly isolated glacier.
Yep. That's a puddle.
Err, are those my footprints? Shoot!
The excavation crew's down there.
Guess it wasn't structurally sound.
A waste of building materials.
Hooboy, that's a powerful stench.
What a waste of materials.
We all gotta sleep.
As abandoned as an old warehouse.
One weird sculpture.
The materials were worth more than the statue.
%s was disassembled by %s.
That was a one-way ticket.
Yeesh! I'd take a hammer to that.
Sticky. I'd rather not walk on it.
I swear that thing's gotten bigger.
Looks like free marble to me.
I could take it or leave it.
I'd rather having building materials than art.
I could probably fix that up a bit.
Needs a proper repair job.
Creepy. Let's fix it.
There we go, back in one piece.
Doesn't that give you a good, satisfied feeling?
A job well done.
Something else needs to happen.
Lava!
That... is a rock.
Yikes. Not a good way to go.
We thought she was gone...
This is too strange.
A bit snooty.
Mhm, yep. That's a rock.
Woah! What an odd texture.
I could learn a thing or two from this.
Wow. Can't even see the weld joints.
In need of a good fixin'!
I don't think it's done yet.
Job well done! Now what?
Moonlight's good for the complexion, hey?
Hm. This wasn't assembled right.
That's... strange.
Solid stone.
Come on out, don't be shy.
%s got disassembled by %s.
Why's this table givin' me the creeps?
Shoo!
Let's fix that up.
I just can't stand disrepair.
Someone's in need of a fixing.
At least it's not trying to kill us now.
Something scare ya? You look petrified!
There's gotta be something good in there.
Never seen such a clear lake before.
There used to be water there.
Looks movable.
I'm just not tall enough.
Watch yer step.
That thing's a workplace hazard.
Can't fool me, ha!
Inventions? What sort of inventions?
Don't worry, we're nearly done.
Huh? You talkin' to me?
I'll fix ya up right proper!
You're a pretty lil fella.
Hm, wonder if I could use this energy somehow.
Wonder how far down it goes.
It's a nice, warm spring.
I'm not really a bubble bath kinda gal.
Woah, the top glassed over solid.
Dry as a bone.
Somethin' inside is itching to get out.
Wonder if it's got any special properties.
Can't wait to try this out.
They're picked clean dry.
It's a big rock in the middle of nowhere.
I don't wanna see whatever's in there.

Into the depths!
Nah, I don't want blacklung.
Another day, another creepy cave.
I don't need fresh air.
I barely remember what the surface looks like.
That's a big mushroom!
I guess they grow better down here?
It's huge!
Woah! It doesn't even need electricity!
Not at all like the lightbulbs I'm used to.
Yep, yep. It's a rock.
Ah! A rock.
A rock filled with spiders. Great.
There's something gross in there.
Ha! Smells like me after a full shift!
Take a gander at this tiny fern!
Just a bunch of leaves.
That's, uh, a banana tree.
Big ol' burnt banana tree.
They're at capacity down there.
Nah, it's packed up there.
I'm gonna leave that right alone.
Stink.
Not a fan of the smell.
Whew. That's an odor.
There's spiders in the crawlspace.
I've breathed in worse stuff at work.
Never hurts to have extra light.
That's how I feel after a long shift.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
No bones about it, that's a fossil. Ha!
Some more assembly required.
That was not assembled correctly.
What is this a skeleton of?!
I gotta disassemble it and try again.
Don't think that'll work.
Is it wise to go deeper?
Into the depths!
I'd never wanna meet one in person.
Needs a good fixin'.
Some incredible stuff could be assembled here.
Ha! Gross.
A heap of spare parts.
Hand craftsmanship is old hat. Mass production is the future.
In dire need of repairs. Good thing I'm here.
Just needs a spit shine.
Not to my lichen. Ha!
Best not open that.
Maybe there's loot inside.
I regret poking my nose so far down here.
I hear whispers. It wants something.
It's passing its judgment.
It didn't like that.
I guess I'm worthy.
Oughta turn on somehow.
It's gearing up for something.
Not sure I trust strange portals anymore.
I don't think we oughta be here when it goes off!
It won't be running again for awhile.
Don't think it's supposed to look like that.
I think it's supposed to turn on.
Not sure how it works.
There's a picture on it of some strangely shaped people.
Can't make heads or tails of this picture.
The people are drowning in axle grease.
Yuck. Something grotesque is happening in this picture.
A picture of a beautiful, well engineered city.
It's giving me goosebumps.
That'll keep the boat right where we want it.
Busted right up, hey?
That needs a fixin'!
Better get to hoistin'.
That thing don't look stable.
I'm ready for a sea adventure.
That's a chunk of road.
That's a chunk of grassy ground.
That's a chunk of rocky ground.
That's a chunk of squishy ground.
That's a chunk of weird ground.
That's a chunk of mineshaft.
That's a chunk of muddy ground.
That's a chunk of ground.
That's a chunk of ground.
That's a chunk of fancy ground.
Incredible! Let me look at those gears!
How industrial.
No way that was made in a factory.
You're in rough shape, hey?
You look awful!
Get a load of this spalder.
C-Charlie?
Ha! I know all your moves!
Yeow! Rude!
Anyone got rolled up newspaper?
Get outta here, bucko!
Keep those fangs to yourself.
Sure hope no one comes back for it.
I don't like you.
Get back to work!
No sleeping on the job!
You'll look better on the underside of my workboot.
Lazy spider.
It's just trying to get out of work.
Ha! How indecent.
Unprocessed silk, fresh from the spider!
Some sort of... festive devil?
I could carry a whole warehouse in that thing!
You sure are ugly!
Yep! That's a frog.
Shouldn't you be off hopping or something?
It croaked.
Hands off!
A real good whackin' stick.
Looks a bit spotty to me! Ha!
Don't even think about touching me.
Is there no end to these things?
I've done worse jobs.
Hands off, buddy.
You don't look so tough.
I have no idea what's going on!
I don't want nothing to do with that.
Maybe you oughta retire.
Nice kilt.
Get a load of this chomper!
Oddly comforting.
Once you've dealt with bedbugs, mosquitoes aren't so bad.
Stop wriggling, it's gross.
Ha. That's real gross.
Gah! I hate bugs!
You know I can see you, right?
Pfft, I can spit further than that!
Flyin' rodent.
That doesn't look right at all.
That is not a comforting texture!
Y'know? I'm not even gonna ask.
It's just a mouth!
That's WAY too fuzzy.
That's a nasty looking spider!
That's a huge worm!
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Mhm. That's dirt!
Looks like the old foreman. Ha!
At least there's SOME steel around here.
Quite the set of chompers on that one.
Why does a tree need a mouth?!
Done and done.
Shoo! Get outta here!
Looks dangerous!
Monarchy is an outdated ruling system!
I'm gonna squish that!
Kinda feel bad for the little fella.
Better safe than sorry.
Yikes! Someone burn that thing, quick!
That pup looks awful!
Well, it looks more peaceful at least.
Sorry, Fido.
Yeeshkabob! What happened to your... everything?
Better than it being awake.
Sorry, fella.
Urgh! What's wrong with it??
Down and out. For now.
Don't get back up.
Heh. Big lug.
Looks like I made a friend.
Lazy.
Ha! That's just vulgar.
We're friends now.
You're getting soft!
Wow! You're in top form!
Rein in that attitude before I rein in you!
Smelly, but warm.
Watch out for the business end!
You're not too young to work.
You're too young to be lazy.
BEEEES!
She's an incredible worker.
Stay back, bug!
Workers gotta look out for one another.
You can just calm right down.
I don't see the point. Oh wait, there it is.
Hey there, ya lug!
Chummy fellow!
That threw a wrench into his plans.
The backside of an oinker.
You really oughta get some sun.
This piece fell off. Shoddy craftsmanship.
Hey! You look tasty!
I don't mix well with the upper class.
Easy there, slugger!
Just don't seem right.
I hock those up after a long day at the factory.
Broke, but I might salvage something useful.
Gotta protect my noggin! I keep my ideas in there.
No monkeying around on the job.
It lives off the hard work of others.
She'll keep the rats outta the factory.
Grab life by the tail.
You and I are gonna get along.
Electrifying! Ha!
It's even more interesting up close.
You play nice with the other lizards now, hey?
Lookit you, all orange!
I hope you earned that break.
It has no work or responsibilities. Poor thing.
How you doin' in there?
Looks a bit flighty. Ha!
Hauling you around is murder on the feet! Ha!
She ain't bothering no one.
She feels real fragile in my hands.
You're just feather and bone.
Not a whole lotta use for that.
Kinda useless. Looks nice, anyway.
If only I had a cap to put it in.
The light's on but no one's home.
Toolbox controls.
Something upset it.
Burnt up eye stick.
Who's the cutest lil toolbox?
Running after it would be pointless.
It's skittish.
Natural light, huh? Might be useful.
I could think of a couple uses for these babies.
That's a weird shrub.
This is exactly what having a little sister's like.
Dead as a doornail.
Dead as several doornails.
Get along, little snurtle.
Go ahead, give'it a punch.
Check out the peepers on this guy.
He deserves the break.
That's one big flower.
Did we not water it enough?
Burnt bits of big ol' buzzer.
You can see right through'em.
Doesn't look useful.
Dutiful little miner.
Taking a break from the mines?
I love it.
Is that lizard made of grass?
Who left you out here all alone, hey?
Yeesh. Fishfry.
You wanna be my toolbox, lil guy?
That brings back memories.
I should take it with me if I go spelunking.
Everybody out of the mineshaft!!
That's not a good sign.
Seems friendly enough.
You're a happy little fellow.
Let's fatten you up.
You need some meat on those bones. Do you have bones?
Maybe we shouldn't hatch this.
It's feeling right as rain.
Looks chilly.
Aw. That's a baby tooth.
We could probably wake it back up.
A bouncy fluffster.
Looks like she has a new addition.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Cute lil bird. Never seen one before.
Hope you're comfy in there.
Taking her mandated break.
Yer an orange nuisance, aintcha?
Aw, I can't stay mad at you.
Sleep tight.
That don't look good.
Cute little fella, aintcha?
So... you like engineerin'?
Look at the legs on that one!
That looks mighty tasty.
Someone's an empty nester.
You wanna be an omelet, don'tcha?
Dinner!
This one just might hatch.
That crunch was upsetting.
It's sweating buckets.
This egg's gonna freeze over.
You've got your work cut out for ya, lil guy.
I can see the beak!
Ha! You're so tiny!
Sleep well, fluffnugget.
You feelin' a bit peckish? Ha!
Yeesh, you ain't lookin' so good.
We all go through that awkward stage.
Sleep well, awkward fluffnugget.
Are you ever not-hungry?!
Stop whining, I'll feed you when I can!
Yeow! Lay off!
The trees have eyes!!
Back off, you lumbering lumber!
Better stay out of her way.
This is disgusting.
Don't even think about it, you dumb lug!
You lookin' at me? Are YOU lookin' at ME?
I've had about enough of terrible beasts!
That's a doozy!
Bring it on, ya big lug!
Real soothing to run your fingers through.
Oh, mama!
Animals don't build things well.
Don'tcha just wanna noogie it?
I could think of one or two uses for that, tops.
Get a load of this flying welding torch!
Showy.
Woah! Hot potato!
Just a rock, now.
That's where the mom keeps her babies.
It's the queen of bees!
Snoot city.
Get out of here ya big creep.
The mitts are coming off!
This must be the actual key.
I got this.
Hole lotta nothing.
Something's in there.
I don't got this!
He's tougher than he looks... but so am I!
An unethical weapon, plain and simple.
Fire in the hole!
A weird and not too welcome texture.
That thing's terrifying!
Hey!
I don't want that anywhere near me!
A bit creepy, isn't it?
Makes me a little uneasy. Heh heh...
Smells kinda like gasoline.
It's been thuribly depleted.
Well, you're a tall piece of work.
Those hooves've never seen a day of work.
How are you, boo?
At least it doesn't have steel-toed workboots!
Who's that good-looking gal!
How's the weather up there?
Looks like we're safe for awhile.
That is not a happy monster.
It's uh, a rock. Mhm.
Let's get a move on.
Hit and a miss!
Things are getting gritty!
That's a hazardous decoration.
It's a big hunk of glass.
I feel like... they've seen my sister.
Hey %s! How ya doin'?
Hands to yourself, bucko!
Mad scientist! Get'em!
You're good people, scientist.
Stop whinin', %s, it's just a scratch!
You better not have singed any of my projects, scientist.
Good ta see ya, %s!
Yer a workplace hazard, %s.
She's mad! Get'er!
Knew I could count on you, %s.
Ha! You're a disaster, %s.
Business as usual.
How you doin', big guy?
I wouldn't wanna catch the business end of those mitts!
Watch out! He's got a taste fer blood now!
You're just a big softie, aintcha?
Walk it off, big guy!
Was that fire an accident, %s?
Hey there, %s.
Woah there, slugger!
She's not playin'! Murderer!
You got a sharp mind in that noggin, %s.
I hope you left the other guy lookin' worse.
Anythin' you wanna tell me about that fire, kiddo?
C'mon, %s! Justa tiny peek under the hood!
Yeesh. They're on the fritz again.
I'll reset you to factory standards, bot.
Ha! The bucket'o'bolts has feelings after all!
Incredible! You gotta tell me how that works, %s!
Your logic lets you set fires, %s? Why?
How's life treatin' ya, grams?
Yeesh, that ol' librarian packs a punch!
Watch out! Grams is on a rampage!
Don't worry grams, I won't read too much into it. Ha!
You're a tough one, %s, I'll give ya that.
A fire? Here I thought you were responsible, grams.
You down ta chop some trees for me later, %s?
Watch where you're swingin' that thing, %s!
Yikes! Axe murderer!
You're a good, honest guy, %s.
You're fine, %s, I've seen worse.
Well ain't that somethin'.
You're just a walkin' disaster, ain'tcha, %s?
Is this normal for you folks up North?
I'll getcha a heart, hold yer horses... er, mooses?
Don't even think about goosin' me!
Well if this ain't a fine feathered mess.
You're gonna start a forest fire, %s!
Don't worry %s, I can talk enough for two. Ha!
Didn't know ya had it in ya, %s!
Killer mime! I'll have nightmares tonight!
Thanks for the assist, %s.
Let's getcha back on your feet, %s.
You responsible for that fire there, %s?
So... %s.
Don't make me noogie you, %s.
How many lives you plannin' on ruinin', %s?
Nice job, ya big walnut.
I could just leave you like this, hey?
Mysterious fires follow you like a plague, %s.
Hey, %s! Arm wrestle rematch later?
Woah! Watch that right hook, %s!
Takin' the warrior thing too far, %s!
That was good work there, %s.
Well that just won't do at all!
Quit startin' fires, %s!
How's life treating ya, kiddo?
Yeesh, kid, dial it back!
Killer spider! Get it!
You did good, kid.
You'll be fine, kid, yer a boxer.
Alright, %s. Why'd ya set the fire?
That's a good lookin' gal!
Ooo, I'm gonna disassemble you.
Pfft! I'd never murder so openly!
I owe ya one, %s.
That is not a good look on you, %s.
Haven't we lost enough to fires, %s?
Hey, %s! Heard any good jokes lately?
Keep them claws to yourself, how about?!
Look out! %s is positively demonic!
Thanks for the assist there, %s.
Oof! You need a hand there, %s?
Were you plannin' on putting that fire out?
%s! How ya doin', ya big bean sprout?
Yer on thin ice there, %s.
Time to roll up my sleeves and pluck a few weeds!
Keep up the good work there, bucko.
You're not slackin' off, are ya?
Watch where you're lightin' them fires!
Hey, %s! Got anything tasty for me?
Watch where you're throwin' them oven mitts!
Killer chef! Get'em!
You're a real pal, %s.
Missed your snack break, didja %s?
I'm sure %s knows how to handle grease fires.
Hey there kiddo, how's it going?
Sure you wanna do that, kiddo?
I gave ya the benefit of the doubt, but that's it!
Whew, not bad, kid!
Don't you worry, I'll fix ya right up.
Hey, who let you play with that?!
Hey, %s! How ya doin'?
Hands to yourself, bucko!
Murderer! Get'em!
You're good people, %s.
Stop whinin', %s, it's just a scratch!
You better not have singed any of my projects, %s.
Breakfast.
I always get bits of shell in there by accident.
Someone's eatin' good tonight!
Cooked meat, ready to eat.
It'll last awhile like this.
Looks like grub to me.
Well, a morsel's a morsel.
Meat to go.
Hooboy! Is that even meat?
It's still purple in the middle.
Drying didn't help none.
This is beyond confusing.
It cooked up pretty good.
Can't say a raw drumstick sounds too appealing.
Can't be beat.
I'd rather eat for a day than not at all.
I hate picking bones outta my teeth.
You're looking a little eel. Ha!
I'll eat anything once.
I'll eat it. Don't think I won't.
Singed the nosehairs right off.
Not glamorous, but I'll eat it.
Them's good eats.
Surprisingly meaty.
Meat's meat.
A little on the puny side, ain't it?
Not a lot of meat on that one.
It's just a teeny thing!
My fish dinner might be a bit lean...
Not sure that fish is healthy.
Here's hoping it tastes better than it looks.
Now that's a nice fat fish!
Yeesh, I'd better watch the spines on that thing!
Never been much for superstition.
Never had to shuck a fish before.
A handful of loose berries.
A bit charred in places, but I don't mind.
Everything since I got here has been bananas.
Caramelized banana's the tops.
Snooty fruit.
Cooked the snoot right out of it.
Powerful stench! I respect that.
Whew! That'll put some hair on your hair.
Eat that and you're stuck here forever!
It does look pretty tempting.
We used to slice these up on hot summer days.
This was an odd choice.
They're so juicy!
They're still pretty darn juicy.
Free food from the ground.
Easier on the gums. Not that that matters.
I talked its ear off. Ha!
Tell me if I get'em stuck in my teeth.
Look how weird it is! Ha!
Did that make it better? I don't know.
Hey there, pumpkin.
Not bad! Kind of sweet.
Let Max try it first.
Not too interested in trying that.
Yep. Green mushroom.
Doesn't look TOO deadly.
Yep. Blue mushroom.
Well, I don't THINK it's poison.
It glows just as much on the way out, lemme tell you.
Not to my lichen. Ha!
It's got a sharp taste. Ha!
That seems a lot safer.
Much less prickly.
This one's a bit shrivelly.
I'll try anything once.
Well, that's not how I would have prepared it.
I kinda like the stuff!
Not sure how to crack this nut.
I think I could eat it now.
Who knew rocks were so tasty looking inside?
Makes ya big and strong.
I'm not fussy.
Makes everything taste better.
Bet that brought out the flavor.
I hate chopping vegetables.
Done and done.
Ye-hooo! They gotta a kick to 'em.
Just the smell is making my eyes water.
I just think they're neat.
I've always been a meat and potatoes gal.
Gotta appreciate havin' fresh vegetables.
I prefer'em fried and green.
A hearty breakfast for a full day's work.
Never liked having butterflies in my stomach.
Where's the beef?
I've never seen a fish this shape before.
That's some good eating.
The sweet taste of good planning.
It's really not as bad as it looks.
Gotta get those vitamins, I guess.
Think I could fit that whole thing in my mouth?
Not bad!
Now that's my kind of cooking.
It's vegetable soup, now.
Don't mind if I do.
Hearty.
Not sure meat's supposed to be that color.
You work up a mighty appetite at the factory.
Gotta eat what you can around here.
Gotta indulge sometimes, hey?
Lots of fresh veggies.
It's practically bursting.
Proper treats stick to your teeth.
We're eatin' well tonight!
Fancy eats.
Bet I can fit them all in my mouth.
Yuck.
I guess a bunch of petals count as food.
This green mush ain't bad!
Y'gotta eat it before it melts.
A good treat for work breaks.
I'm tough enough to handle a little spice.
All the energy you need for a long day at work.
I would eat them all in one sitting.
Huh. Interesting choice but I ain't complainin'!
Cool and refreshin'!
Knocked it out of the park again, bucko.
Now that's some tasty grub!
Can't believe Warly's got me eatin' salads.
Fruit wrapped in a blanket of pancake.
Mmm! Love Warly's dishes.
I'd never turn down grub!
You really outdid yourself with this one, buddy.
That's good eatin' there, Warl'!
I'm all for getting my daily iron but this goes too far.
What's this fancy stuff? I like it!
Lookit that, Warly's at it again.
My mouth's havin' a party!
Looks great, Warly!
Count on Warly's cookin' to always make my day.
Wish I had some chips to go with this.
I could use one of these after a long day.
You can really taste the electricity.
Some seeds. Not sure what kind.
Some carrot seeds.
Some corn seeds.
Some dragonfruit seeds.
Some durian seeds.
Some eggplant seeds.
Some pomegranate seeds.
Some pumpkin seeds.
Anyone wanna see how far I can spit the shells?
The sweet results of honest work.
There's no flight in their future.
This makes everything better.
Wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole.
Yeesh, get a whiff of that. No wait, don't!
Please. I hock bigger loogies in my sleep.
Looks edible. One way to find out!
I'm a growing gal, you know!
It's a melon seed.
A big bee boogie.
What's this going to grow into, I wonder.
I got no idea what they'd grow into.
I got no idea what they'd grow into.
Wonder what these'll make.
I got no idea what they'd grow into.
I got no idea what they'd grow into.
Blueprint paper just smells right.
I'm a bit homesick.
Sooty.
That was a... Y'know! A thing.
Glitter doesn't really appeal to me.
It's a gem. A gem that's blue.
I like gems best before they're cut.
Now that's a proper gem.
I don't like it.
Ha! Disgusting.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
What? We all do it.
I was never much into marbles.
It's got no film to make a sound.
Everyone's been real good at showin' me the ropes. Ha!
Looks like my old landlord. Ha!
Handcrafted. Yuck.
The copper's probably valuable.
Was this whittled... by hand? Blech!
No bathtub in sight.
Where's all this junk coming from?
All bite and no bark. Ha!
Maybe this bot'll let me poke around its insides.
Hey Willow! Dare ya ta eat it!
No time for star gazin'.
I swear the kid'd lose his head if it weren't... wait.
Whew. These got crunched real good.
Ahh, interesting!
What a nice little flower.
It's getting antsy.
Something's coming.
It wants down.
What do you want? Water?
You're alright for an axe.
No fun without Wes.
Oh! A balloon.
I don't trust that thing one bit.
Progress on paper!
Wouldn't mind lining my workboots with this stuff.
What a nice drawing.
Hey! This will come in real handy next time I go fishin'!
Some sort of old power source.
This is twisted.
Such a shame to let good food go to waste.
Looks like my old landlord. Ha!
Tea's not really my taste.
A bit highbrow, don'tcha think?
A waste of good metal.
Handcrafted. Blech.
This is why we need production standards.
I can reach my own back! Watch!
Nice and mechanical.
I got no use for that.
I prefer to break workboots in myself.
That's a knight.
The reliable quality of a mass manufactured product!
Ha! Nasty!
That thing's an affront to manufacturing.
That's a rook.
Not a lotta use for that out here.
It saw me standing alone.
You coulda been a useful necklace.
You get sawdust in your eye?
You lookin' at me?
That's amore.
Quit staring.
Pretty! Pretty useless.
Did it just get chillier?
That's real pretty.
It's a colorful bucket.
Hefty.
Yeow! Don't make me come back in there!

AshesAshes of Thing- 

Divining RodDivining Rod (before picked up from its starting base)- 
That's a Voxola! What's it doing here?
I'm probably one of the few left that knows how to use these.
S'not picking anything up.
It's getting something.
Gonna hit paydirt any second now.
I'm sitting right on top of... something.
Just like in the bossman's workshop.
I guess it wants the Voxola?
At least I assembled it right.
I ain't jumping willy-nilly through strange portals!
I prefer blues.
How does that even work?
That's a safety hazard.

Sick Worm HoleSick Worm Hole- 
That thing can't take much more.
Neat contraption. Can I take a look at it?
Who'd wanna sit on THAT?
He doesn't look none too happy.
She doesn't look none too happy.
They don't look none too happy.
So THIS is 'Maxy'.
Incredible! I have no idea what that is.
Ha! Outsmarted!
Brr! Cold as frozen steel out here!
I'll demolish you!
I'm the engineer of your demise!
We're makin' bacon!
I hate spiders!
Let's dance!
I quit!
...Demolition's rescheduled.
I went easy on you!
This isn't over!
Next time!
BEEEES!
There's the quittin' bell.
I can't see!
Whew! I can see!
Low visibility causes workplace accidents!
I can't do that.
How did I junk that up?!

Trying to sleep during the day- 
Can't sleep now, there's work to do!
No way I'm falling asleep here.
Not without supper first.
It ain't safe.
They're busy working.
They appear to be dead. Very dead.
They're off the clock.
It demands poop!
Those dogs I hear?
Was that a tremor?
Democrew incoming!
I only got two hands.
I can't right now.
It's full to bursting.
That's just impractical.
I'm not really in a cooking mood.
I gotta get closer. Or grow longer arms.
I'd NEVER misuse a tool.
Smooth as sheet metal.
Dirty work's not for broad daylight.
I'm better with my hands than my words.
It's a bit preoccupied.
Can't assemble anything from up here.
That hits the spot.
I've had worse.
I regret everything.
Yeow! That one bit back!
When's lunch?
Heh, whoops.
Out like a light.
Yeow! That smarts!
It'd be a pleasure to fix it.
Earthquake!
Ha! Now you gotta kiss me!
It's hotter than a tin smelter in July!
Ah, that's better.
A light mist never hurt nobody.
I oughta find some shelter.
This is just uncomfortable now.
I'm DRENCHED!
I meant to do that!
That's gonna start a fire!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Democrew incoming!
That's NOT fine.
Nah. I'm a one-pet gal.
Let's throw down!
ooOooooO!
You're not looking too good, big guy.
Only one to a beef, hey?
We gotta repair this ol'girl!
We're goin' down!
Pfft. A baby could assemble those.
That's above my pay grade.
That ain't gonna work here.
Gonna have to make this under the influence of the moon.
Aw someone else is building it already.
Square peg in a round hole.
I gotta have something to build with.
Oops! Wrong plans.
How's the grub coming?
No rush.
I don't wanna ruin whatever Warly's working on.
Workin' hard, or hardly workin'?
That'd clog the assembly line.
It doesn't fit together like that.
Uh... I hope everyone brought hardhats.
Shoddy handmade junk!
I gotta stay alert!
Good thing I got all my affairs in order.
No one should ever lose a sister.
Some things even I can't fix.
A flare! Hold on, I'm comin'!
My head's all fuzzy...
I don't have it in me right now.
HOLY RIVETS! Time to make tracks!
He called his goons!
That ain't right.
Success!
Thanks for the lift!
Hang on, I'll getcha outta there!
Nearly through!
Ha! Gotcha!
It needs something else.
It doesn't need this.
What sort of worker do you take me for?
Nn-nn. That doesn't go there.
Whew! If that isn't the mightiest smell.
That helped a bit.
Pretty sure that's not food.
Blech! Even I got limits!
Do these trees seem shadier?
They're busy working.
Seems they're dead.
I'll hold onto it for now. They're all loaded up.
They're off the clock.
They've got their hands full.
Not a keen idea right now!
I can't open anything up here.
That one's already been glitzed up.
Can't do that with all this glass in the way.
Uh. It's on fire.
Shoot. I hate working in wet clothes.
Useless handmade junk!
I can do ANYTHING!
Mitt me, kid!
The life of the party has arrived!
I don't break down easy.
You are but a cog in my machine.
Heh heh, this thing's itchy.
I can tough anything out.
You seem to think you got a chance. Let's fix that.
Thought and conscientiousness nips all problems in the bud.
There's few things more satisfying than watchin' something grow.
Let ol'Winnie fix ya up somethin' special.
Honest work makes an honest woman.
Tough as obsidian.
Ha ha! Did I scare ya?
Time to roll up my sleeves.
Come on. Give it your best shot.
You don't intimidate me, big guy.
Is that supposed to be intimidating?
I mean why not, right?
They say you can't go home again.
A big clump of tree.
That guy's got no concern for others. Pfft.
Gah! I hate bugs!
Some sorta crusty rock.
A real scorcher!
It's losing heat.
That ain't burning no one.
That was a cinch.
What kind of bonehead leaves stuff half-built?!
Yeow! That still needs some tinkering!
What an incredible tool!
Lazy builders.
The foundation's crumbling.
Yeow!
Too lazy to do your own chores, Max?
Hellooo? Anyone in there?
Make way! I'm coming through!
It's packed. I'll stay put.
Could use a bit more kick.
That's a proper furnace.
We oughta fix that.

WETPAPER- 
Is something written on it?
You here to help, lil fella?
I could start a small garden with this.
A good start.
Better than a market.
There's a whole mix of seeds in here.
Bunch o' different seeds.
A lotta variety in here.
It's a ceramic dish.
Makes eatin' soup a lot easier.
Warm soup. Nothin' better.
A lip smackin' snack.
Bread is the best foundation for every meal.
Fancy pasta dish.
Full o' veggies to make me big and strong.
A hearty meat meal.
Still got that fish smell.
Ohh... a fancy dish.
You gotta love cheese.
Good for someone with a sweet tooth. Like me!
Doesn't look great.
I didn't know lizards could wilt.
You got a bone to pick with me, bub? Ha!
This was a terrible idea.
Who thought this was a good idea?
Nope.
...H-hello?
Cutting edge!
I can build even MORE things!
I'll take what I can get.
Oh no you don't!
Slippery devil.
I don't do that anymore.
Misusing tools'd be a workplace hazard.
Roaring like the twenties.
It's childish, in a comforting way.
Who would want a non-electric lamp?
Just like vacations at the cabin.
This rock is more useful than the rest.
Food poisoning and a half.
I make a mean Hoover Stew.
Still got a bit of a wait.
Not even factory standard.
Now that's a mighty fine gadget.
That's a nice chunk of road.
That's a chunk of coal mine.
Not sure I'm musically inclined.
Clever.
So tight I barely remember my hunger!
That's a work hazard.
So you're telling me this stick is magic?
Dweeby.
Well it's no tin lizzie.
I love getting new materials.
Such craftsmanship!
This Thulecite stuff is incredible!
Needs something from a beefalo's backside.
That's one house I wouldn't mind tearing down.
Is that an untapped mine?
I didn't order lunch to go. Find that beast!
It seems like it'd be unwise to plant this.
Nah, I don't want the black lung.
Take a look at this tiny cave fern!
Some incredible things could be built here.
Completely outdated. Mass production is the future.
A complete misuse of the beauty of engineering.
Did the get you, too?
Charlie? Is that you?
Yeow! Quit it!
Stay out of my mines!
That just don't seem right.
Broke, but I could salvage something useful.
Not a lot going on upstairs in that one.
It's a bone with an eyeball on it.
Don't even think about it, building-killer!
Caramelized banana is great.
Hard to get ahold of fresh veggies.
Let Wilson try it first.
The engineer's canvas.
Wish people'd clean up after themselves.
We're not goin' gnome anytime soon. Ha! ...Oh.
That's an incredible piece of machinery!
I hate half-built things.
Ha! Out-engineered!
Another hard day of work comes to an end.
Do I hear dogs?
Innovation!
Now I can build more things.
I regret doing that.
Woah! Earthquake!
Someone could hurt themselves on that, Max.
Roaring like the twenties.
You guys like charcoal flavor, right?
Such a tragedy.
A very rural look.
Are those my footprints? Gah!
The mine wasn't too structurally sound.
Used to slice these up on hot summer days.
Is eating that covered by my benefits?
All the energy you need for a long day of work.
Still not as fast as a tin lizzie...
How's it work without any wiring?
Look at all that fungus.
How practical.
Oh. Well then.
It's okay. We'll build another.
We already made note of that one.
Is it my turn to feed the bird?
Err, was it my turn to feed her?
So very waxy.
It runs on magic instead of electricity.
Hmph. Just for show.
Not sure I like that one.
It's busted. Ha!
What, do I gotta offer it up to something?
That venom stuff stings!
I've repaired roofs before but this is a bigger job.
Under used 'n overgrown.
Ready for assembly!
It runs on magicy stuff.
This magic stuff's pretty useful.
I need to put this somewhere for it to work.
I need to bake this somehow.
I've skinned my own meat before.
I think that old goat made this herself.
A lucky penny.
Hey Max! This tree looks like you!
Not sure what to think of that...
That plant doesn't give up easy.
We thought she'd disappeared.
%s got demolished by %s.
I've breathed in worse stuff underground.
You wanna come mine some coal with me?
Everybody out of the mine!!
An unusual and not very welcome texture.
We couldn't just leave well enough alone.
It blocked my blow!
More than a bit unsettling.
Smells like gasoline.
Admirable craftsmanship.
You got a good head on your shoulders, scientist.
%s's turning out to be a major workplace hazard.
She's gone nuts! Get'er!
All that butt talk and you went and got yours handed to ya!
You're just a big softie, ain'tcha, %s?
Woah! Watch it there, slugger!
You got a sharp mind on ya, %s.
That's fine so long as you left the other guy lookin' worse.
You got somethin' you wanna tell me about that fire, %s?
C'mon, %s! Justa lil peek under the hood!
I'm gonna reset you to factory standards, bot.
Yeesh, the librarian packs a punch!
Nothin' you can't handle, %s.
A fire? I thought you were the responsible one, grams.
Don't worry bucko, I'll do enough talking for the two of us! Ha!
Killer mime! We're havin' nightmares tonight!
Stop making that face, %s. You're not gettin' workman's comp!
We both know that's not gonna stop ya, %s.
Mysterious fires seem to follow you like a plague, %s.
Hey! Arm wrestle rematch later, %s?
Shake it off, %s, there's work to do!
How's life treating ya, squirt?
It was %s, not me! Swear it!
You're not me! I'd never murder so openly!
We're supposed to build machines, not fires!
They're still pretty juicy.
It's a nice little flower.
The sleek quality of a factory produced product!
Did it get chillier out here?
This gem feels sad.
She used to have such a big heart.
Nothing stays dead around here!
Demolition!
I hope everyone brought hardhats.
What sort of engineer do you take me for?
It's closed for business.
Sometimes the direct approach is best.
It gets sharper with every cut.
This is some real advanced technology.
This shovel is worth a princely sum.
Everybody loves a little mining.
This must be game logic.
If only the world had a single neck.
It feels good to undo the work of others.
The tool of choice for perfectionists.
Not as elegant as a quill and inkwell, but it'll do.
It's like showing affection, without actually touching it.
But that means I'd have to touch the smelly thing.
At least it affords some dignity to the rider.
But is it fast enough to escape the judgmental stares?
And I may never put it back on.
So salty.
Truthfully I was always a hack.
I've always wanted to hack things in luxury.
Aren't there gardeners for this sort of thing?
I keep it next to my pocket watch and my pocket comb.
Sure beats darkness.
That will keep Charlie away for now.
A roaring fire.
Firey.
It's hot.
It needs fuel.
It's getting low.
I'm going to lose it.
I should attend to that.
That's not coming back.
It's gone cold.
It keeps Charlie at bay.
Eventually the firefly will starve.
Why hello, Mr. Crane.
I hope this keeps Them away.
How comforting.
A fire pit.
That will keep Charlie away for now.
A roaring, cold fire.
Cold and firey.
It's cold.
It needs fuel.
It's getting low.
I'm going to lose it.
I should attend to that.
That's not coming back.
It's gone warm.
No wonder they can dig for hours.
Safe keeping for my hard earned fires.
Their lives have found purpose in servitude.
Sailing at night seems unsafe, but I guess this makes it a little better.
It lends all around it an eerie glow.
The stone was born for this.
A roaring fire.
It's burning in style.
It's getting low.
I should attend to that.
It's gone cold.
A little light in the dark.
It will protect the flames from the waves.
I may have overdone it.
It's burning just fine.
There's barely any heat.
A flame not long for this world.
Out like a light.
The wax better not drip on my suit.
How delightfully horrific.
Curses. Another light down.
I hope it keeps Them away.
Someone should attend to that.
I suppose we're decorating with fungus now.
A rather pale light.
C'est la vie.
I'm partial to the lavender shade, myself.
A light to repel the encroaching shadow.
Who ordered the mushroom flambe?
It does the job, I suppose.
I wish there were porters around here.
Oh that's just demeaning.
They keep falling for it!
Good for capturing defenseless insects.
I will eat for a lifetime.
I don't like sleeping rough.
At least they're good for something.
That's a bit rustic for my taste.
Only the dumbest animals will fall for this.
Sticky and gooey and good for putting on booboos.
Just a bit of venom and some dirty old ash.
It's crooked!
North.
South.
East.
West.
Northeast.
Southeast.
Northwest.
Southwest.
I've lost my way.
I guess we could wrap a few things up.
I don't know what to wrap.
Nice and snug.
Its contents are hibernating.
Is it windy out or is it just my fan?
Rustic, but excellent shade.
It's sleep-time, not siesta-time.
They're hot on my heels!
Traditionally, a siesta comes after eating, not before.
It's a bit creepy out for that.

Tent BurntTent (burnt)- 
That's a bit burned for my taste.
So much for the shade thing.
A pocketful of stone and temperature.
It's almost too cold to hold.
Pleasantly cool.
Comfortably lukewarm.
It's almost too hot to hold.
It's more pretty than dapper.
Not much, but the extra space is better than nothing.
I suppose it will do.
It won't make me stronger, but it'll give me more pockets.
Is it windy out or is it just my fan?
What am I supposed to do with this?
It serves its purpose.
A cure to what ails you.
Phew.
This will put that horde in its place.
What use are birds to me?
Is it windy out or is it just this fan?
I'm not sure I really want to give this up.
Who would put this filth in their veins?
Do you have any idea how much this suit cost?
This pathetic device... gets the job done.
For those with a flare for the dramatic.
It makes me a little nostalgic.
Just what am I looking at here?
How truly unnerving.
It's seen better days.
I've been reduced to hauling my own foodstuffs.
Just the thought makes my mouth water.
Wait for it...
Here it comes!
Finally, some quality grub.
That can't go in there.
It holds my bees.
My bees are not working hard enough.
I should wait a bit longer.
So tempting, but so full of bees.
Do I look like a farmer?
I have better things to do than watch plants grow.
It's ready.
It needs to be... refreshed.
A little piece of winter in a box.
It can dry meats so that they last longer.
Still moist.
Like the desert.
A bit overdone for my tastes.
Honey roasted.
A harvest of ashes.
Moist and staying that way.
It's too brittle to hang meat on now.
Much better than carrying manure in my hands.
The mussels won't be able to resist.
They'll grow where I tell them to.
I need some fish eggs if I want fish.
I put the eggs in. Where are my fish?
Success! A fish.
The more the merrier!
I better not see any rowdiness, fish.
Who would ever need this many fish?
Good. Now I don't have to water by hand.
It holds the bees.
Why do the bees not serve me?
It's not gentlemanly to carry manure in one's hands.
Smells... 'piney'.
They seem to be doing well.
The mushrooms have really taken to the log.
It's so full it's almost obscene.
Rotten, all the way through. I relate.
Only ash and ruin remain here.
Nothing grows in these frigid wastes.
An instrument of the dark culinary arts.
Let's hope something palatable has come of it.
Does it have to make such a horrible racket?
Ah. The daily grind.
Finally something with some taste.
I can't believe I forgot how to build those things.
It unlocks recipes of middling utility.
Not the most useful invention, is it?
I could also just look up to learn the same thing.
A little bit of protection.
Energy flows through it.
Now this, I like.
The fire learned how to burn it down.
Flames have swallowed it whole.
Who cares?
The rain did not come in time.
Quiet before the storm.
Begone, fire!
Not much fuel left.
I don't understand how it works, but it does.
There are watery mysteries to be unlocked yet.
It's working hard to make ice for me.
It appears to be doing its job.
I'd better fill it up.
It's on its last legs.
It's not doing its job.
I will quack open the sea itself.
Finally we're catching up to the Iron age.
Ah. Civilization.
Now THIS I like.
Mapmaking is a soothing pastime. Methodical.
Such directionless destruction.
Useless.
A block of marble might suffice.
To sculpt, to carve, no more.
That is certainly not for sculpting with.
How I've missed the act of creation.
Occupied.
Ah, yes. Not terrible.
That can already be made here.
Now to see if Higgsbury's ideas hold water.
Well, it's useless now.
Even They couldn't build something so devious.
It's a spear. Yup.
An undignified weapon for a less refined time.
Beats getting your hands dirty.
Ow! Clumsy!
A glorious tube of pain-giving!
Call me Mr. Sandman.
Just make sure to breathe out.
Now I am ready for the scrimmage.
Direct confrontation is quite gauche.
Ugh. I'm not one for such vulgar fisticuffs.
That really isn't my style.
They wait so patiently.
This one packs a wallop.
That's some fly mail.
Good morning.
Wind power.
I've made sure it packs an extra wallop.
I've turned the venoms of this world against itself.
I foresee death in the future.
I may want to take cover.
This projectile flinger may come in handy.
A gentleman's weapon.
Sometimes one must sacrifice form for function.
Perhaps not the sturdiest, but it will conceal my vulnerabilities.
It renders me... sluggish.
Nothing says... stay away... quite like this.
A blade as sharp as my wit.
Easy enough to carry.
This is not a good look.
A hollowed out head. Don't ask where I got it.
The indignities I've suffered...
How very conquistadorian.
Not very pliant but it does the job.
A weapon after my own heart.
Ready for the scrimmage.
Well... it's no crown.
I can appreciate a finely crafted weapon.
Never strikes the same place twice, except when it does.
Makes me feel like the master again.
It appears to be a sleeping bag.
This doesn't look dapper at all.
You'll never get me behind bars again.
I feel for ya, feathers.
You'll still be in there when you wake up.
That's like their only trick.
I'd go inside too, if I was him.
I'll huff and I'll puff!
Oh, isn't that clever.
Pocket-sized wall pieces. Yup.
It's a tinderbox.
Moderately tough, but flammable.
This will keep the riff-raff out.
A place to store loot.
It says... nothing.
How quaint.
A sign is useless if it has nothing to mark.
There's nothing on it, currently.
My memory isn't good enough to draw from it.
It was drawn in a steady hand.
A fence for your pocket.
My life is one obstacle after another.
A gate for your pocket.
When one gate closes...
Let's see you hide in there now.
Cleverness killed the carrot.
I told you so.
Not tough, nor flammable.
It won't store anything now.
Those scales sure are nifty.
Somehow, it says even less now.
I found that wholly unenjoyable. I swear.
Decorative sand.
Is this what passes for architecture around here?
Keep me away from that.
Where should I begin building my fortress?
It will hold.
I see no reason to disturb them.
A bag of dirt I can carry.
A bag of dirt that keeps water out.
I hope you're prepared.
Useless!
It floats with ease.
My suits had best not get moldy in there.
Ah. I need a castle like that.
I suppose I could place this on the water.
About as well constructed as sea trash can be.
I know just what to fill it with.

Don't Starve Together
Pig House BuildPig House- 
It is not a sound structure.
What's all the fuss about, feathers?
Oh, come on. I fed you last week.
That's a deep sleep.
Maybe he wasn't sleeping.
This requires profundity.
'Thataway'... Ugh!
Somehow, it says even less now.
An empty vessel awaiting decoration or light.
Purely decorative.
A temporary reprieve from the shadow.
I believe it is Wilson's turn to fetch bulbs.
Every lovely flower must one day wilt.
That was uncalled for.
It's an empty shell of a man.
Nothing is safe.
The scarecrow has gone to a place where there is no fear.
Where should I put this?
I like to build walls between myself and the outside.
The red gems are producing a sweltering heat.
Fashion without function.
Oops.
Dapperness is a state of mind.
How could you improve on perfection?
Oh. There go all my good pocket squares.
They're in much more dire need of it.
You're hard to kill. I respect that.
Not especially impressive for a 'throne'.
Someone finally took care of that hideous throw rug.
What is that little creature up to?
Such a waste of time and energy.
You'd think this would have more uses.
Roughly hewn.
The building blocks of civilization.
A blank canvas.
Purple brings great power.
Ahhh. Refreshing.
I miss sealing a good letter.
My interest in this wax paper wanes....
I've fashioned the bamboo into something useful.
Perhaps this sea life's death will find use after all.
Given enough time I could build a ship inside.
It's not bald! It's distinguished!
You're on your own, tree.
This will make a decent magical vessel.
Let me guess, it grows a marble stalk?
Hopefully it catches the wind as well as the eye.
I'm not above using this.
Quite a dapper machine.
This is where I do my own personal research.
I'm going to sing a song of madness.
It burns with a beautiful glow.
Time to wrap myself in nightmares.
Snicker-snack!
It has a good beat and you can dance to it.
Violence has never felt better.
Wet, soggy, and oddly filling.
It's frosted over.
It speaks with the shadow.
It channels the darkest energies of the universe.
A basic enchantment, but effective.
Cool staff.
Power can do amazing things when it's funneled through the right channels.
That should do the trick.
The fuel needs more focus points.
This one's ready.
The fuel needs a focus.
I won't be using it any longer.
It was too hot to handle.
Research complete.
More bell.
Such a fascinating device.
Ashes to ashes.
Goodness. It's been awhile since I played.
Scientifically proving pigs can fly.

Pugalisk WandPugalisk Wand- 
Penetrating.
Another door.
An exit but not a way out.
Not exactly dapper, but how can I say no to this?
Keeps my things just where I want them.
It's like it was tailored just for me.
No one will be using that any longer.
That was its final act.
Wrap yourself in the nightmare. Embrace it.
This is a conduit for strong revelatory magicks.
The gem conjures water springs in conjunction with the 'moon's' cycles.
The... 'moon'... has retreated for now.
The 'moon' is waxing.
The 'moon' is full in the sky.
The 'moon' is on the wane.
The cave provides sanctuary from the 'moon's' prying eyes.
Walking gets tiresome, you know.
The magic beckons!
It seems he's learning to bend the curse to his will.
Ugh, it offends my eyes.
Almost as powerful as it is tacky.
A fine and noble endeavor.
They are at least warm.
A hat fit for a peasant.
How unfashionable.
I'll wear it if I have to.
I will lure them in with my plumage.
How disappointingly rustic.
Some fine haberdashery.
It's no three-piece, but it's dapper enough.
It's more of a fall vest.
It's so hard to look fashionable in the winter.
There's room in there for me.
Definitely not my style.
It has pictures of fast things carved into it.
Dead head.
This is one way to keep cool. And sticky.
Strap some ice on your head.
Out out, rain!
Not the most dapper of hats, but quite necessary.
Safety before dapperness.
The dapperest of them all.
Eye to the sky.
See my vest.
I feel inspired.
Quite dashing, actually.
Quite dapper!
This is undignified.
Sigh.
I hope this won't tar-nish my dapper image.
Cleans the stench away.
Quite sleek, if not elegant.
I respect this fashion choice.
This looks silly.
This clears the vapors.
Protects my most important part.
Electrifying finery.
I always considered myself the peacock of people.
Not my sort of fashion.
Function over form.
It possesses a spritely magic.
You really expect me to wear this?
This seems rather... fishy.
An exceedingly rare but useful material.
Pocket-sized wall pieces. Yup.
An ancient wall.
The heart of the city is still.
It beats once again.
The pulse is quickening.
The pulse is holding steady.
The pulse is waning.
It calms once more.
The pulse has no influence here.
Simple magic is often the best.
This will make me stand out.
I swear I don't normally need this.
I must rely on focusing tools in this form.
With a bigger gem it would be so much more powerful.
I don't know why I didn't think of this.
Fuel must flow.
Thulecite meshes so well with nightmare fuel.
The fuel runs deep in this.
Now I just have to set it up.
Some of my better work.
It's a focusing tool.
A crutch for pitiful mortals without godlike powers. What?
It is a focusing tool.
The duality of mine.
Now it just needs to be set up.
It seems like there should be regulations against this.
Looks much too precarious for my liking.
Manually operated. A pity.
Ah, plenty of room to breathe.
This boat knows how to take a hit like a champion.
It seems sturdy enough to carry me.
Seems dependable.
It will hold off my vessel's inevitable decay.
It will be smooth sailing with this at my back.
It will aid in my travels.
For ease of travel.
I suppose it's better than paddling.
Thank goodness, I have places to be!
It's about time I got my hands on one of these.
Quacker before me!! Uh, I mean quiver...!
The curiosity will get the best of you eventually.
Out of commission. For now.
Much needed ship maintenance.
This maintenance machine needs maintaining.
It's no use to me if it's off.
It's doing its job.
The contraption needs replenishing.
I see no downside to using this.
Just think of the meals I'll make.
It's working its way down.
Into the depths...
This may help me get the lay of the land.
It makes me feel commanding.
Is this amusing?
Swashbuckling...
Sadly my cultured countenance must take a back seat to sensibility.
Looks barely seaworthy.
This seems like a dangerous thing to farm with.
It seems to work best when alight.
I've made sure it packs a fiery wallop.
I've bent the flame to my will.
This is definitely overkill.
Beautiful on the outside, destructive on the inside.
A stick, presumably for sailing.
It feels at home in my hands.
This will deal with those pesky traps.
For more subtler smashing jobs.
Must I do everything myself?
Let's see what we can find.

Lamp Post (on)- 
A welcome sign of civilization.
I presume it's a pigsty inside.

The Sterling Trough Deli- 
Finally some decent food.
A common boutique to purchase common goods.
Seems even filthy pigs need the occasional pampering.
A simple grocer.
Every breastpocket needs a fresh rose.
Hmm... I may be in the market for some oddities.
Ahh... more my style.
Well, well, well...
I may have use for a millinery.
Hmmm... The are a lot of artifacts in there.
Can I exchange this money for anything useful?
Full of schemes and plans. Like me.
I could run this place better.
I deserve that.
Oh good, I can hire some help.

Slanty Shanty BuildSlanty Shanty (owned)- 
An estate of my own.
There's an appeal in overseeing the masses.

Don't Starve Together
Map ScrollMap Scroll (Cave)Map Scroll (empty)- 
There's nothing to be gleaned from this.
A wholly agreeable animal.
You're a slobbery little chap, aren't you?
Quit nibbling my coattails.
Just like old times.
You are much too trusting, friend.
You're as fowl as I am!
You had better not chew holes in my suit.
This seems cruel.
Ceci n'est pas une pipe. Pity.
I have no idea what that is.
This is nice, but where's the rust? The exhaust pipes?
A dreadful lack of accordions.
Could use a few more mechanical bits in my opinion.
The pieces are in motion!
And I thought chivalry was dead!
Must everything be about my shortcomings?
What a well-dressed figure!
I don't like winters.
A brute.
What an imbecilic expression.
It never stood a chance.
Rather elegant, I'd say.
How kitsch.
I'm fairly partial to this one.
They always need an offering.
I suppose I should build this.
Go on. Axe me what the moon's made of.
Sharp like my wit.
It smells quite nice, if I'm honest.
I've been reduced to a common shipyard laborer.
I have no desire to toil like a common sailor.
Hmph. I've never been one for manual lab-oar.
I detest such work.
Can't someone else assemble it?
Do I look like a shipyard laborer?

Steering Wheel KitSteering Wheel Kit- 
Hard labor? Isn't that Winona's forte?
Reading strange books has always worked out for me before.
What a wasteful misuse of magic.
It's not wise to toy with forces beyond your comprehension.
I haven't had a real sleep in... ages.
I've had enough fire and brimstone for one eternity.
What horrors shall be summoned from the depths?
The wilderness is tough on a tailor made suit.
I could have thought of that.
It's useless out here without power.
I'm going to pretend I don't see it.
Oh. What a pity.
Well sure, if you want to take the easy way out.
Where does she find the time to build all this.
I think it's losing power.
See? It wasn't so great after all.
At least she has the sense to use gems.
Magic isn't so easy, is it?
Who's frail now?
Best laid traps.
I'm utterly dung with all of this.
Keeps everyone from getting too close.
I never was one for syrupy mush.
Bit of a kick in the pants.
My doctor said I shouldn't have too much.
That's our sugar-sack.
Oh good, it's solid candy. I feared something healthy had snuck in.
Waxy, just like me.
Almost endearing. Almost.
Eating them makes me feel powerful.
No one is above enjoying a good lollipop.
Black licorice, my favorite.
How the tables have turned, worm.
Who is making all this candy, exactly?
I am much more disappointed than I thought I'd be.
A mystery I'm not keen on solving.
Ah, maggots... how novel.
It's not terrible.
Only ruffians enjoy torturing themselves like this.
I told you people, I am *not* a vampire!
Amateur magic for children.
I'm not in the habit of imbibing strange liquids.
Permanently bared.
I'm done tampering with magical oddities, thank-you.
The opposite of dapper.
You are all ants in my eyes already.
What a tacky glove.
One hundred percent to scale.
I've no idea what that is.
It looks cheap.
What use would I have of such a thing?
Rosebud.
At least it's not ragtime.
Some harebrained invention of the scientist's, perhaps?
How maddening.
Takes away the horrors. But who would want that?
Ah. This'll do the trick.
Could be a little stronger.
Might as well throw it in the fire.

Totally Normal RootTotally Normal Root- 
Ah. A chance to grow something horrible.
Just days away from dreadful.
Such a burden to carry it. If only there were a place to leave it.
Why do I hear 
Ugh. These guys again.
Oh joy. Is there really need for decoration?
I like the real ones better.
Shouldn't it be hanging from somewhere.
Quite an expert illusion.
I was never really scared of those trees anyhow.
For wrapping odds and ends...
An elegantly wrapped social obligation.
How repulsively festive.
That's that, it seems.
Have we nothing better to do with our time?
How wretchedly jolly.
It’s a Winter’s Feast miracle.
Can we turn our attentions back to survival now?
Stop looking at me, cookie fiend.
It is unbound from time.
We're celebrating freezing to death, I see.
I don't even use a cane.
How, err... traditional.
It's extremely rich.
Glorified apple juice.
Such a decadent beverage.
My... favorite... she remembered.
Gaudy, like the rest of this shindig.
How frivolous.
What a thing to risk one's life for.
A volatile decoration.
There's something familiar about this...
It seems my fortune's changing.
Something else seems to be required.
It's no use to anyone now.
A spot of luck.
Gold's gold as far as I'm concerned.
Great for magic tricks.
Not having a light would certainly be unlucky.
Now I'll have no problem keeping my cool.
Quite formidable looking.
I'm no middleman.
The back end of a terrible beast.
The preparations have been made.
It requires a torch.
Burnt to cinders.
Howl I ever find a use for this?
I was wise to be suspicious.
I don't trust it.
This earthen beast's all fired up.
How delightfully disconcerting.
I'll need somewhere to sculpt it.
It's quite fetching.
What a gruesome maw.
How quaint.
It needs some kind of meat.
Not useful like this.
Ah. I do enjoy a nice meal.
Ugh. More fit for a creature than for me.
Nothing fancy, but it will do.
Those pigs are getting more and more clever.
Filthy.
A fiery one.
Rotten to the core.
He's a slippery fellow.
It's much too late for that.
Ugh. I'm not doing anything in that mess.
I have bigger things to worry about right now.
I don't need this anymore.
You seem severely deluded, good sir.
Begone, swine.
I don't fear you, scoundrel.
He's rather thick-headed.
I should like to avoid a pinch from that, I think.
What a brute!
Well he's certainly no slouch.
Brutish grotesquerie.
Back to the dungeons with you!
Meddling with it will only cause further trouble.
Let us end this chapter of our journey.
A key is key.
Right as rain.
It's a one-way portal.
We must destroy that Battle Standard.
Disgusting.
You shall serve us.
I could be persuaded to dabble in white magicks.
A staff after my own heart!
I could stop a fiend in its tracks with this.
The words within evoke an unknown force.
I would never resort to something so brutish.
I would never stoop to such things.
How churlish.
I have no desire to use that.
Too brutish for my tastes.
That is not my style.
I'm no blowhard.
Not really my style.
It is nearly useless.
Swiftly useless.
It offers a serviceable amount of protection.
This was intended for someone physically-inclined.
Decent protection that will enhance my power.
Seems heavy.
Quite a clunky looking thing.
A little extra armor never hurt.
That is not suited to me.
I'd never wear such an undapper thing.
You'd need a thick neck to wear such a thing.
Horsefeathers.
It will quickly restore my powers.
I must have it.
A decent wreath, should I feel like healing.
I could use the invigoration.
Self sufficiency in wreath form.
Allow me to assist.
No need to thank me.
That was simply undignified.
I have no use of such things.
May I peruse your wares, ma'am?
He has no future ahead of him. A shame.
Good day to you, sir.
I tip my hat to you sir.
Charmed, I'm sure.
Fast asleep.
Don't touch the suit.
It's seen better days.
How are birds getting in here?
It is no more.
You can't hide from me.
Those are never growing back.
Perhaps it has some flavor to it.
I could, perhaps, produce a makeshift garnish.
It's as hollow as this withered world.
Foul.
I don't have time to watch twigs grow.
Aromatic.
That's not growing back anytime soon.
A sickly sweet aroma wafts from its branches.
It won't produce sap now.
It is filling. Ever so slowly.
The sap is ready for collection.
Well it's ruined now.
This tree has seen better days.
Creeping ivy.
Best offer it something if we enjoy living.
I'm not sure how it draws magic from this.
Nobody listens to me.
I do like a good statue.
Misdirected dedication.
Carriage carnage.
They didn't pray hard enough.
Something has happened here.
Nobody has kept up with repairs.
A late clocktower.
If only it lead somewhere.
It's no longer over anyone's head.
Some kind of gargoyle.
Well that's attractive.
It could use renovations.
It's been a long time since this stood properly.
Spikey. Like me.
It needs a key.
Seems we've got it open.
This looks like it requires hard labor.
Just useless rubble now.
It's a post.
A bit excessive...
The stinking abode of those filthy fish creatures.
Now for some expert-level rummaging.
I cannot open it.
Let's see what they have today.
Well what do we have here?
Brackish.
It's a monument to death.
A touch of civility.
A little civility.
Time's up.
Yes yes, ashes to ashes and all that.
A bicycle built askew.
Well I'M not setting it up.
I can put this to good use.
It's an oven. For cooking.
This will make things much more convenient.
At least it's portable.
I'd prefer a larger grill.
No use to me here.
I believe I can barbeque.
I shalln't let it speak with the kettle.
Magic could bring it to a boil faster, you know.
A tiny bit of domestication.
Homey.
I need to sweeten the pot.
Just useless sticks until we assemble it.
Any method to improve the food around here is welcome.
Ah. It's ready.
Dinner should be arriving any moment.
This is so very beneath me.
I don't mind getting my hands dirty with this.
It's already sticky.
And they thought their things were safe.
This should open some doors.
Good. I can get out of here.
Instruments of toil.
Am I supposed to plant these?
Foul smelling, but delicious.
I do enjoy a good smoked salmon.
Ah, how refined.
Perfect with a bit of butter.
I ought to mix it in with something else.
Fungus has its uses.

GarlicGarlic- 
I suppose that's why there are no vampires around.
I wonder if it still wards away the undead.
It's a pungent onion.
Take that, onion.
It is in the nightshade family, you know.
The potato may be eaten now.
It's a red, red tomato.
It's a red, red roasted tomato.
It's a big, bulbous turnip.
Hardly improves the taste.
This would be more useful as flour.
I suppose one could make baked goods with this.
My bones are naturally fragile, I'm afraid.
It must be ground down before we use it.
Adding too much is an a-salt on the senses.
I would rather not get that on my gloves.
Bittersweet.
Cooking syrup. Of course.
That will spice things up.
Spicy.
Well, well, well...
I'll have use for this.
On my way up in the world.
We may wyrm our way out of this predicament yet.
Let's see how the wyrm likes this.
Nope. It won't eat that.
This is exactly what the wyrm wants.
Well, I suppose it will tide the wyrm over.
I didn't cook that one.
Suitable lavishness.
Refined dishware.
I shall have to find the key.
I've already put this on a dish.
Clearly this is the wrong dish.
We've already placed something on the altar.
That wouldn't be a very good sacrifice, now would it?
It appears there's another key around here.
It's unavailable.
This combination of food was ill-advised.
Curses! Too slow.
This may be the end.
The Gateway is ready!
I've heard them described as 'piney'.
It looks sickly.
A tree with a foul demeanor.
That's not about to grow back.
I put it out of its misery.
Tree 0, Maxwell 1.
Oops.
There it goes.
Bathed in fire.
Dust to dust.
It's no use to anyone now.
Huh, it seems to belong in the ground.
It's a piece of wood. What more is there to say?
Well. That was fun while it lasted.
Nothing will steal my carbon!
A more outdoorsy type might be able to make something of this.
How whimsical.
It's got a face.
I like the noise they make when you burn them.
A supple, woody stem.
It'll grow back.
Do I look like a gardener?
Common, but useful.
That's not doing anyone any good.
Nothing to harvest.
Needs manure.
The mundane stuff of the earth.
Reduced to eating berries. Sigh.
And now we wait.
It needs manure.
There's wind in them there willows.
No more tubes.
I think I could build something useful from this.
That is a generic plant.
It's growing.
It's ready.
What a generic little plant.
It's twisted and thorny, just like me!
That was painful.
I should ask it questions.
I am filled with the irrational urge to stomp upon it.
Like so much confetti.
I like that flower.
It's dripping with nightmare essence.
How mundane.
It's a red mushroom.
I'll have to come back for it.
It's all used up.
Green fungus.
When do those ones come up?
Been there. Done that.
The blue ones are good for something.
It's not ready.
Another time, maybe?
I've heard them described as 'leafy'.
That's not about to grow back.
Oops.
Bathed in fire.
Huh, it seems to belong in the ground.
Nothing survives in this heat.
You'd think grass could withstand this heat...
Too hot for that little bush.
It wasn't hardy enough for the heat.
A more outdoorsy type might be able to make something of this.
Puffer plant.
Cactus? More like flat-tus!
Tumble on, weed.
It can grow through just about anything.
I believe it wants me to chop it down.
These have taken over the island.
It needs time to replenish.
I have used it for my own purposes.
Used up, for now.
It is not long for this world.
It will not be returning.
In another lifetime, perhaps.
It's met its end.
I suppose I should find a place for this.
I should find a proper place for this.
Good. I was right.
I could replant this, theoretically.
I have several ideas in mind for this.
It's twisted and gnarled.
It is partially submerged.
I wonder what it's thinking?
It thrives here.
A tree like any other... but wet.
It has been destroyed.
How luxurious.
It can't hurt anyone anymore.
Now I just need servants to fan my glorious self!
Nothing out of the ordinary here.
Not of much use to me.
How handy...

An acquaintance of mine describes them as 'leafy'.
Where did this appear from?
Utterly destroyed.
The tree of an amateur.
That's not about to grow back.
Oops.
Bathed in fire.
Look at you. You're useless.
It's of no use in its current state. Only time will tell.
I could plant it... but why?
Looks a little off, if you ask me.
What has brought this blight upon my world?
The berries will stay fresh as long as I leave them there.
I fear I'll have to wait.
It looks to be in need of assistance. Fertilizer, perhaps?
I could find a much better place for it.
I know the feeling.
Stone cold growth.
I've found a shrubbery.
This is wrong.
Doesn't look that succulent to me.
It didn't put up much of a fight.
Disgusting. I'll have someone else pick it.
We already took the food parts.
For keeping the peasantry in line.
It appears to be a piece of drifted wood.
We've chopped it up already.
It seems to be burning.
It's in utter ruin.
Oh good. More wood.
It's a moon tree.
Someone's chopped it down already.
It's burning.
A burnt tree stump.
It came from that odd tree.
It's a small moon tree.
It labors to make my dinner.
What use are you to me if you don't have fruit?
It is fruitless and useless now.
It resembles Woodie, does it not?
I think it's sick or something.
It's ill.
Well that's a shame.
How off-putting. It's grown a sprout.
Not the bees!
That looks dangerous.
It's full of bee seeds.
It's a tunnel down to the hound nests.
Hungry devils, aren't they?
There's a story behind that...
I can see its true nature now!
There are two ways to see that obstacle.
It only half-exists on this plane.
Not my best work.
I've always wondered who built those.
It's strong stuff.
They copied the pigs, but they're even less intelligent.
The eyes follow you around.
Er... charming.
Great. Now they have fire.
I made a rock so heavy that I can't lift it.
It's a rock.
Hmmm. Now what do I do with them?
Ow! I cut my finger!
One third of the way there...
This was important to me once.
What lies beneath?
Already got that one.
That looks out-of-place.
Some dumb beast passed through here.
Drat! It got away.
I smell dung and beast-sweat.
My beautiful machine is in pieces!
It is still incomplete.
Now to turn it on.
It's alive!
This is the quantum field guard band.
This is used to agitate the humours.
This is a box full of sadness and woe.
The gears in here are so small they turn the fabric of reality.
It's worse knowing what the other part looks like.
I can assure you that it smells worse than it looks.
Yech. It's horrible in there.
I can see my face reflected off the top.
Ha! I remember that one.
They grow big here.
Squishy.
There's a world going on under there.
The Walrusser can't be far.
I best not linger when winter comes.
This bird's vessel is clearly not seaworthy.
I'm not sad to see that bird go...
Perhaps I could reel it in somehow.
Baby glaciers.
I could get a chip of ice off the old block.
It's just a puddle.
Can't follow it in these conditions!
Burrow deep, I'm coming for you.
The entrance has collapsed in on itself.
It burns just as well as the pigs' version.
Roasted merm head. Delicious.
Pig roast!
Vermin housing.
Well, I guess that's that.
Hey, that's not a statue of me!
That'll teach it to not be me.
The master becomes the student.
All things are doomed in time.
It can't hide forever.
I suppose everyone needs to live somewhere...
They copied the pigs, but they're even less intelligent.
It burns just as well as the pigs' version.
They would be much more content in my stomach.
Show yourself, delicious critters.
This could likely support a wide array of life.
It's quite lovely.
You're not cute.
Could be used as a food source in a pinch.
Just a rock now.
Well, it's a rock.
This puts on quite a spectacle.
Quite a dapper briefcase if I do say so.
A little mound of yellow sand.
Rocks so thoroughly crushed they are no longer recognizable.
It stirs when I mention treats.
An ordinary pile of sand.
I respect its power.
It radiates an oppressive heat.
You've given yourself away, pal.
Foiled by a fish!
I've lost sight of the whale!
Pursue the beast!
Something foul festers beneath.
Congealed evil.
Slow going.
Much deeper than it lets on.
Exceptionally toasty.
Seems like a convenient gathering of food.
They're oblivious to their approaching death.
I admittedly have a penchant for tempting fate.
It's calling to me to dive in.
It looks... rotten.
What nonsense is this now?
Perhaps I could pry it open.
Lovely ambiance.
A little kitschy for my taste.
I can see it just fine from here... No need to get closer.
It's bursting with potential.
Ah, what's this then?
Oh good. A talking sack of stuffing.
Not all find a final resting place.
It stood no chance.
I see the makings of something quite handsome.
Excellent. Not long now.
Another piece of the puzzle.
I do admit it's a little ridiculous.
Ah, another piece.
What will this unearth?
Blech.
I refuse to touch that.
Tempting...
There's no head on his shoulders.
Seems part of a whole.
Well that looks interesting.
I'd hate to see the rest of it.
A solid mineral.
There's something sparkling inside there.
I suppose any gold is good gold.
Ugh. The horde home.
I've no interest in a commoner's domicile.

Thank goodness, I thought it was another wretched statue of me.
The fewer statues the better, I say.
Always did have a flair for the dramatic...
I don't see what all the buzz is about.
I am not getting that on my shoes.
Now what are those bees up to?
Some truly questionable taste in decor.
Hmph. I was never a fan of the Grecian look.
Waste of good marble if you ask me.
Why would anyone want to cover this up?
Come now! I liked that one.
My creations! How rude.
Doesn't that feel better now?
That looks much better.
Back as intended.
At least it's back in one piece now.
We'll get you out in a tick, friend.
A touch hot, but could cook my food in a pinch.
With each day I get a little boulder.
At least the fire cut down on the smell.
She's still in there somewhere. I know it.
Her tragedy does not define her.
Hm. Stately.
It's a rock.
'Moon' rock.
Oooh, some new knowledge.
A bit ominous looking.
Ruins of an ancient relic.
I had thought these were all destroyed eons ago.
Something magic-y needs to happen, I think.
The staff is powered by the 'moon's' energy.
Waste of a good staff.
This might be bad.
I think it looks much better this way.

Rock DenRock Den- 
Am I being watched by that rock?
A pity, %s. He was not prepared for %s.
A pity, %s. She was not prepared for %s.
A pity, %s. They were not prepared for %s.
A pity, %s. So ill-prepared for %s.
This must be the work of an unseen hand.
Hmph. Impressive sleight of hand.
That's quite the schnozz.
That looks... familiar...
I've seen that head before... but never in marble.
Not so tough.
Try and get me now. Ha!
What goodies lie within?
Didn't think I'd ever come back here.

Cave-in BoulderCave-in Boulder- 
Well it's not going to move itself.
We must deal with the others first.
It's just a silly starfish.
Devious thing.
What would be the most devilish place to put it?
Yes. I desire the knowledge of the moon.
There is powerful energy pouring out of it.
This is not its desired destination.
Let me know your wishes, and I will oblige.
Where shall I take you?
It's not shadow magic.
I've more important things to deal with than holes in the ground.
I miss a good long bath.
How posh.
I could make use of that glass.
It's of no use to me like this.
The thing inside wants out.

But does it look as sharp as me?
Adapt or perish.
It would be easy to wreck a vessel on one of those.
I'd rather not peek inside.

Compromising Statue- 
For when my defenses have been compromised.
I plugged it a long time ago.
That was not a good idea!
Off to plunder the depths.
Get me out of here!
Onward to the next thing.
Where's Waldo?
Ugh, it smells bad.
It smells of rot and failure.
It's so dark down here.
It will run out eventually.
Rocks. How dull.
Stalagmite. How dull.
How did that get down here?
That's revolting.
What a disgusting home.
I'd like to step on it.
A meal fit for a peasant.
It looks like a banana, but I'm not buying it.
I refuse to be held responsible for that.
Rather dreary. I like it.

Don't Starve Together
SinkholeSinkhole (full)- 
When it's less claustrophobic, perhaps.
I'd rather stay here than mingle with the crowds above.
Ugh. It stinks.
I hope I'm not standing next to it when it goes off.
Oh fine, do what you like.
It's spawning.
Could it get any less appealing?
Magical red, and yet it holds no power of use to me.
Hateful, ambulatory whimsy.
How can a seed be so cheerful?
I hope it doesn't stain my jacket.
It got what it deserved.
You aren't fooling me, plant.
Perhaps it is best left in pieces.
The beginnings of some demonic beast.
It will be the laughstock of the demon community.
Was it wise to unleash this upon the world?
The bones were too amateurishly assembled.
It refuses to bend to my will.
Probably shouldn't venture any deeper.
A once proud race.
This can be partially restored.
Where are their gods now?
It's some algae.
There's a reason I never finished that.
That one was a jerk.
Didn't like that one's face.
Remnants of an extinct civilization.
Just bits and pieces of rock.
I could combine several piles to make a bigger piece.
This fungus survived the downfall.
It's a trap.
It's almost like he's still alive.
The overuse of fuel was their downfall.
Several of these piles could be combined to form a bigger piece.
A slow growing cave plant.
A relic best forgotten.
It seems I am to be judged.
It's deemed me unworthy.
Was there ever a doubt?
It lacks a key.
It is feeding off the dark energy.
This is a most wretched idea.
Now we've gone and done it.
Best not to overuse this power.
I can't believe I've forgotten how to read this.
No fuel, no power.
It feeds off the nightmare.
A picture of the city, before the fuel.
We all know that happens next.
They gained such an enviable power…
I know why you led me back here.
But it won't work.
There's a dreamlike quality to the material.
This workstation ignites a spark of creativity in my heart...
Delightful coffee beans.
I've picked them all.
Barren.
Decay has overtaken it.
This is worth replanting.
Take cover!
It won't be shooting anyone like this.
Good riddance.
I better not run with it.
Exceedingly sharp.
It refuses to bend to my tools.
What a delightful color.
I can't help but admire the natural formation.
Had I any pity, I would give it to this tree.
Quite uncouth.
We are all trapped, in one way or another.

Volcano AltarVolcano Altar of Snackrifice- 
It appears to be a place of offering.
Do I dare play with more forces beyond my control?
I must take my leave.
It looks like it could fall apart at any time.

32pxNasty Spear Trap- 

32pxBusted Spear Trap- 

Tempting Idol- 

Unimportant Pillar- 
Functional, but a little dull.

Wall Brazier- 

Wishing WellWishing Well- 
Shall I take a chance?
Finally a chance to get something I wish for.
I do like this...
Oh those hideous creatures are industrious, aren't they.
They've done all the hard work.
Oh look, they discovered light.

32pxStalacmite Throne- 
Might be something interesting in there.
A little garish for my taste.
Is it really worth keeping that under glass?
I can drop it to keep the boat in place.
Merely smithereens.
Oh, great. Now we're going to drown.
Every vessel mast have one.
Jumping off would ruin what's left of my suit.
Why yes, you may call me the 
I prefer hardwoods.
That's a quality, high-pile carpet sample!
That's my natural habitat.
At least this one is useful.
Smells like mud.
Scratchy.
Dirty.
Kinda rough.
It's dripping all over.
Turf.
Turf.
It appears to be some turf.
It appears to be some turf.
Turf.
Provides a solid foundation.
A good cobble road.
A bit gauche for my tastes.
Fertile turf.
It's warm, but quells flame.
Turf.
Such quality workmanship!
I'm especially proud of that piece.
A castle for my home.
It looks beyond repair.
They degrade without proper upkeep.
The builders have left it in a state of abandonment.
Charlie? It's me! Maxwell!
Ow! Charlie, that hurt!
They don't recognize me!
I put fire gems in there as a joke.
I had a lot of surplus gems!
It could be used for fashion.
It's mostly digestive system.
It's a specialized form.
Shhhh! It will wake up hungry.
I don't want to wake that one.
Splat.
Distasteful.
Despite its origin, it could make some fine garments.
You won't catch me!
It's really light.
They were here when I got here.
It jumps and licks things.
It looks tired.
It croaked.
I'm glad the rest of it is still down there.
Ugh. This is so revolting.
This is how they reproduce.
This one is odd.
How deep does this go?
Ugh! How can it live down there?
Babies?
Blech. Disgusting brute.
That one's gone feral.
It remembers me!
Don't you recognize me?
A chip off the old block.
I'll put this to better use.
Made in Scotland.
Bloody bloodsucking bloodsuckers.
I got him.
A bloody sack. With blood in it.
What annoying little bugs.
It's a tricky one.
Aggressive little thing, isn't it?
Ugh. Ugly beasts.
A vicious plant.
Perhaps I can use this to my advantage.
The Meat Bulb's pawns.
Simple creatures. They exist only to sleep and feed.
In death, this creature will serve me!
Creatures in this world evolve at a terrifying rate.
Well that's new!
You aren't fooling me, plant.
Something stirs.
Ornery and tough as nails.
Someone should use this to clean something.
The alpha!
Shut your maw!

BirchnutterBirchnutter- 
A nut with legs! How terrifying!
Oh great, another abomination.
It won't obey me.
Smells like wet dog.
Obey me, fool!
That thing is quite beneath me.
This is quite a stunning contraption.
I'll not be meeting the same fate!
I would like to avoid being bitten by this one.
I'll be taking that blood back, thank you.
A cruel yet elegant beastie.
Perhaps I'll give this one a wide berth.
The texture is delectable.
It's a specialized form.
I don't want to wake that one.
Splat.
It's not a question of if I will conquer it, but when.
It smells quite atrocious.
Perhaps it should have taken more fencing lessons.
We meet again.
I triumphed over it!
Don't you know who I am?
Do I know you?

Gnat SwarmGnat Swarm- 
Horde horrible.
I know the ropes.

Masked PigMasked Pig- 
He's after my money!
A nice hat to hide under.
Now I can steal from that little criminal.
Rather handsome for an amphibian.
What is he all worked up about?
You'll not be stinging me.
Do not tangle with me!
That's one handsome abomination.
I command you to stay back.

Spider Monkey DeadSpider Monkey (dead)- 

Vampire BatVampire Bat- 
You're an impressive creation, aren't you?
Even creatures of the night must sleep.
Thoroughly defeated.
Who knew bat and pig skins were so similar?
An amphibian after my own heart.
Interminable pests.
Ugh.
Ow! Be gentle, Charlie!
They were already here when I arrived.
They're starting to organize.
I didn't make that one! Honest!
The gem imbues its attacks with a fearsome power.
Keep your backside to yourself, madam!
Foul beast! Know your place!
I wish we'd get rid of that.
Good riddance.
It's coming alive again!
If anything ever looked evil, it's that.
I don't desire to rouse it.
That is probably for the best.
What an atrocious beast.
May you never wake.
Good riddance.
How monstrous.
I'd rather not wake it.
Good riddance.
Just look at that stupid beast.
Aw nuts, it's following me.
It's only marginally less stupid when it's asleep.
Now it looks dumb AND pathetic.
I like a creature that knows its place.
I suppose some people might find that charming.
I'd only ride you if I was desperate.
Yes, you understand how this works.
It smells like a barn.
Call forth the beasts!
They're even ugly as children.
Seems we've a few hours of reprieve.

BeeBee- 
They work so hard, the fools.
What is that bee so angry about?
Now what do I do with it?
I've caught a tiger by the tail.
It's dripping with venom.
What a slobbering fool.
He's simple but he's mine.
I dub thee, 'Bacon'.
It was him or me.
It reminds me of my old act.
Silly rabbit.
A distant cousin of the beefalo.
It has its winter coat on.
Nice tux.
I banished these guys down here for a reason.
I don't remember those...
That's strange. They must be new.
There must be a better way.
They don't fit back together.
This will keep me standing, if I need to fight.
That is not dapper at all.
I don't have time for you!
Carrion connoisseur.
Catty vermin.
Tale of tails.
What's it always chewing on?
Chaaarge!
It'd make a nice horn.
Surrender to me.
Size truly doesn't matter!
They're much craftier than they appear at first glance.
I could build a decent castle with this.
It's quite shocking.
What a strange little creature.
It is smelly and very stupid.
The beast stood no chance.
This pitiful creature possesses only a modicum of intelligence.
I'll easily dispose of that swinish brute.
Cease your babbling!
A dull sluggish beast.
Well, it'd make a good hat rack.
What a hideous creature.
Still grotesque.
Serves it right for being so ugly.
A beautiful mutation.
Sharp and pointed. Like me.
What do you want?
Move along.
Some cracks can't be mended.
They aren't very sociable.
I bet it's delicious.
Sleep is only a temporary escape.
It's a flying flower.
It would be a shame if someone ripped the wings off of it.
I don't know how they got here.
Shhhh... My pretty.
The redbird comes from the fire lands.
Silence, bird!
I don't recognize that one.
Quiet, you.
Black is the color of sleep.
Red is the color of fire.
Grey is the color of pain.
It is addicted to fermented berries.
Stop looking at me!
What is it waiting for?
Don't worry. There will be more Chesters.
Annoying little monster. Has his uses, though.
I've been here too long- it actually looks tasty.
Don't worry, rabbit. Everything is under control.
How pretty.
I could squish them if I wanted to.
What a disturbing root.
Oh shut UP, will you?
My ears are still ringing.
It has lost a lot of its power.
Ugh. My head hurts.
A flying goop factory.
Flower power.
Flower power forever.
There's always another Glommer.
They're sticky.
Well, that's rank.
Do you pick up what I'm laying down? Do you dig what I'm burying?
I'll take that as a yes.
End of the line.
Quite otherworldly, no?
An edible crustacean.
The crabbit is hiding.
It smells like wet dog.
A charming monstrosity.
I think I should hold onto it.
A fine powder that smells of destruction.
His irritating appearance is tempered by his usefulness and willing servitude.
Hm. It's very fond of bioluminescence.
Such extraneous colors...
Hm. Colorful.
Perhaps I can shut him up.
It is loud and irritating.
Rather uncivil.
Colorful vermin.
Unlike me, it has no trouble surviving out here.
This sad creature has no hope of survival.
What are their chances, you think?
It would look dashing tucked in a Sunday hat.
Hmm, propagate a dying species or enjoy a light snack?
Whoops.
A light snack is always the best option.
Now there will be more of them.

Filthy.
Enjoy your grimy slumber.
As filthy in death as it was in life.
What a filthy creature.
Sans dungball, I see.
The time is right to strike.
It has come to a feculent end.
Disgusting, but helpful.
He has expensive tastes.
What a regal-looking beast.

How amusing.
How dramatic.
I should stick it in a cap.
You're new.
Nothing up my sleeve...
Looks like I got the last meep.
Are you picking up what I'm putting down? Do you dig it?
I'll take that as a 'yes'.
I'm sure its tail grows back.
Better him in that bowl than me.
His spirit is free now.
Stick your tongue in. You're getting slobber on my pantlegs.
How do these things keep getting into my world?
Bait.
You look atrocious.
Yellow is the color of naivety.
You're not a hellbeast are you? Nooo. Just misunderstood!
It's happy with me, and I with it.
It's hungry. Why is it hungry?
I think it's going to die!
It's alive in there.
I can say with pride that it is comfy and cozy.
I knew I would make a terrible pa-pa.
The lavae's baby tooth.
It's no threat in this state.
Well it's certainly not deer to me.
What a staggering sight!
Filthy.
It's a puffin.
I'm gonna turn you into puffin' stuff.
Sleep is only a temporary escape.
That carrot is revolting!
You thought you could fool me?
I'm sure it is diseased.
Disgusting.
How wretchedly graceful.
You can't escape my villainous grasp!
These were a failed experiment.
Well. That's tempting.
It's made of dirty beefalo hair.
Tallbirds are territorial because of these things.
It tastes like broken dreams.
We've got a live one here.
That tastes about as good as you'd expect.
Hot enough for ya?
It's getting tepid.
What!? What do you want?
You want some food?
He's so hungry!
It's less cute now that it's grown up.
They sure do eat a lot.
A hungry beast is a dangerous beast.
Have patience!
That tasted about as good as you'd expect.
Disgusting creature!

Spider QueenSpider Queen- 
Maybe I'll just get out of her way.
Spiders have such malleable wills.
Even I am afraid of that guy.
Deerclops are myopic.
My my, the fuel has changed you.
I'm sorry I had to do that, old friend.
Take anything you want.
This would make a nice rug.
It's definitely from the North, whatever it is.
Ride the lightning, you big egg.
That's a fluffy... thing.
I could use a pillow filled with these.
A fiery fly.
Fiery.
Spitfire.
It's cold and dry now.
Cease this nonsense.
You will bow to me.
How dare you touch me?
Now for my reward.
Just look at the size of that thing.
I would rather not get sucked into that.

SealSealnado (seal form)- 
It's, uh... cute?
It appears expertly engineered.
I sense a powerful force within it.
Aptly named.
Not something a gentleman handles without gloves.
I suppose they're worth hanging on to.
You're a little agitated.
Oh, I like the look of this.
Can't say I'm sad to see him dead.
How very macabre.
A bit huffy.
I was meant to be king.
Ah. The end is nigh.
A potent fragment of a shadowy figure.
So the technology CAN be brought back to life!
Hello... Let's see what I can make with this.
Stop this ridiculous charade, beast.
Even I'm afraid of that guy.
Deerclops are so myopic.
A regrettable end, my old friend.
Filthy.
I didn't make that one! Really!
Makes one feel like royalty.
My, what a magnificently horrific creature.
Its true power has been unlocked!
Magic has done things to this beast's horn.
Pitiful. I'll make short work of that 'shroom.
It's a dirt hole.
That looks filthy.
What an abomination!
It is coursing with fungal power!
I don't like how much magic is collecting in that.
It's gonna blow!
I hope the warts are not contagious.
There is no limit to the power of shadows.
How dare you!
What trickery is this?
A being of living fuel.
Like all things, it craves the fuel.
A most tragic and unfitting end.
Curious. It smells like roses.
A shame.
Looking good!
That's a man with his priorities in order!
He displeased me.
Why won't these mortals just stay dead?
Now that is surely fuel for nightmares.
Well I suppose there's no sending you back now.
Perhaps I could use his generosity to my advantage.
He's new.
Its got its head in the clouds.

Waxwell PortraitInspecting self- 
I still look dapper, right? As if I need to check.
Have you no pride?
We've placated it for now.
It's going to wreak havoc on my world.
An impure orange gem.
The magic beckons!
That was quite impolite.
Impressive.
I hope I'm not so transparent.
Not the castle I had in mind for myself.
It communes with us through them.
Err, greetings, Mr %s.
You're going off the deep end, pal.
Our truce ends here, murderer!
%s is a real pal...
Are you certain you wish to return to this world, %s?
The fire is supposed to go in the pit, Higgsbury.
Greetings, Ms %s.
%s is not my ally...
Murderous fiend! Taste my wrath!
%s has bent reality to her fiery will.
We will require a heart to bring you back, %s.
She's a firestarter. And a twisted one, at that.
Good day to you, Mr %s.
The strongman %s seems a little unhinged.
Murderous fiend! Behold my power!
%s tethers lost spirits to this world.
Let's find a heart, %s. I'll prepare my incantations.
Did you intend to burn that, %s?
Greetings, Ms %s. How are you?
%s has been corrupted...
Don't think I'll hesitate, murderous fiend!
%s is a true death defier.
%s's looking a little too much like her sister. Needs a heart.
Don't play with fire, Ms. %s.
Greetings, Mx %s.
If you're going to attack, at least finish the job!
Murderous fiend! This will be your destruction!
%s never did respect human mortality.
A shame about your death, %s. You were the only one I half-liked.
Mx. %s is finally making good on their promise of mayhem.
Good day, Ms %s.
%s is withholding information...
Do not start fights you cannot win!
%s has excellent command of the dark arts.
You know the price of revival as well as I do, %s.
Never pinned you for the wanton destruction type, Ms.
Greetings, Mr %s.
%s is going against the grain...
Fiend! Time to make like a tree...!
%s seems very in touch with the spirits of the forest.
That blockhead could use a heart.
Ha! What a delightful curse.
Yew don't look so wood.
Wonderful. A screw-loose moose.
I'll leave you to you moose-ings while I seek out a heart.
Not the most dignified form you've taken.
It seems you've run a-fowl of something, pal.
Is it wise to be starting fires, given your predilections?
Greetings, Mr %s.
%s is giving me the creeps...
Murderous fiend! You cannot escape!
%s is an effective ally.
I could get you a heart, %s... for a price.
Stop burning things, mime.
What a dapper fellow!
I know that look, %s. What are you up to?
Old habits die hard... and so will you!
Trust only yourself, hey %s?
I'll have to pay in blood to bring you back, %s.
Do not blow this for us, %s.
Greetings, Ms %s.
What's %s's motivation?
Bloodthirsty warrior! This ends now!
%s has excellent command of the spirit realm.
Do you desire a heart, %s?
The next fire you start will be a funeral pyre.
Greetings, Mr %s.
%s is looking a downright feral...
So, %s, you're a monster after all!
This child, %s, doesn't have a mean bone in his body.
Looks like you got squashed, %s.
Like a moth to flame. Or a spider, maybe.
Greetings, Ms. %s.
%s has been roughhousing like a commoner.
You've engineered your own demise!
%s expertly uses all tools at her disposal.
My, you're looking spirited today, %s.
You were the last one I expected to start fires, %s.
Greetings, Mr. %s.
Do not make me bind you with magic, imp.
Enough is enough! Prepare to be banished, imp!
Hm. I'll allow you to stay on this plane awhile longer.
Serves you right, meddling imp.
Do I smell fire and brimstone?
Greetings, Mr. %s.
It's time you make like a tree and leaf.
Don't worry, %s. I'll make it a clear cut.
I suppose he has his uses.
What a shame. Now I'll never know what that gem does.
%s has been starting fires, now hasn't he?
Greetings, Mr. %s.
%s seems out of sorts today.
Eat this!
Thank-you for the assistance, %s.
Oh, what a shame.
%s's started some suspicious fires recently.
Greetings, Miss %s.
This is no time for childishness!
%s has revealed her true nature!
Ah, thank you, %s.
Oh dear, whatever will become of your kingdom now?
Who left the tiny green demon unsupervised?!
Greetings, %s.
%s seems untrustworthy...
Murderous fiend! I'll stop at nothing!
%s tethers lost spirits to this world.
%s needs heart-shaped assistance.
%s has been lighting fires.
I like to think of it as baby bird prison.
Sunny side up.
I'm used to much finer fare.
It smells less like barnyard, now.
My teeth are getting too old for this.
This is barely a mouthful.
Well, at least it's not moving any more.
How revolting.
I'll eat it if I have to.
A feeble attempt to trick the weaker minded.
The heat has made this a suitable meal.
It tastes strangely like berries.
Still tastes like berries.
Fresh from the murky depths.
It still stinks.
They only exist in the depths.
It will have to do.
Full of summer mucus.
The trunk thickens in the winter to hold more mucus.
At least the mucus burned off.
Muscular.
Stringy.
I'm not eating that.
I'm still not eating that.
Stay.
Perhaps it should have taken more fencing lessons.
It belongs on a skewer.
I like it better dead.
It will do, I suppose.
That one's not getting back up.
Done, like dinner.
I actually don't mind this?
Could use a touch of fire.
Fish is presumably containted inside.
It still stinks.
Have I been reduced to this?
...Bottoms up.
Slimy and vaguely ingestible.
A delicacy? Really?
They're a delicacy somewhere.
Looks to be less of a health hazard now.
Raw fish eggs. Fantastic.
The fish eggs are cooked now.
Don't you ever blink?
Don't worry, there's plenty of them in the sea.
Delightfully pinstriped.
I'll be picking bones out of my teeth for weeks.
Truly an ugly creature.
Purple on the outside, pink in the middle.
A trophy from a most excellent kill.
Excellent.
I forgot my bib.
Rather disgusting.
Hearts only bring pain anyway.
A delicacy, were it not poisoned.
Shall I risk it?
Loathsome.
Ugh!
It's still filthy.
It slithers all the way down.
Still rather grotesque.
This was barely worth my time.
Hardly bigger than a minnow.
I was hoping for something bigger.
Just a cold fish.
Its smell oddly reminds me of the theater house...
It looks positively revolting.
It has a rather unsettling stare.
I'd best take care to avoid those spines.
I'm not sure it was worth the effort.
What an odd creature.
Sigh. If I have to.
Like ashes in my mouth.
Even worse than raw.
Exotic and delicious.
It's an acquired taste.
Usually I'd get someone to seed this for me.
A little more refined, at least.
It's mostly water. Fibrous, sweet water.
Grillermelon.
Like ashes in my mouth.
Even worse than raw.
Could do considerable damage to a person's noggin.
Its juicy interior is revealed.
It will last me for now.
It's strange to see them this color.
Better than raw, but is there another way to prepare them?
Ashes in one's mouth.
Delightfully sweet with a subtle hint of tartness.
They're quite delicious, actually.
I'm not a fan of vegetables.
High in fructose.
Hallowe'en was always my favorite.
Just another boring plant.
A little more refined, at least.
I forget what this one does.
Kind of bitter.
I should eat it.
Salty!
What could go wrong?
Umami!
What a neat trick.
Dry, crumbly, sustaining.
It would be unwise to put that in my mouth.
Cactus comestible.
This part of the cactus is always nice.
Sea garbage.
I'm loathe to eat this.
Ugh.
I've eaten worse things. Much worse.
Ready for cooking.
Storebought just doesn't taste the same.
I should eat it.
We must always eat our vegetables.
Smells terrible.
Excitable little creatures, aren't they?
Am I really this desperate for food?
I prefer blooms of a darker shade.

NettleNettle- 
Useful.
A reddish radish.
It's at least halfway appetizing.
Looks unripe.
Ugh. Should I even eat this?
At least it's edible.
Looks... edible?
This one isn't very good.
Can I eat something that's not slimy for once?
This was not an improvement.
Sadly, I've eaten worse out here.
I'd rather not shatter my teeth on that.
It's ripe enough to eat now.
It looks almost appetizing.
I suppose that's why there are no vampires around.
I wonder if it still wards away the undead.
It's a pungent onion.
Take that, onion.
Looks like the spicy kind.
Slightly more exciting than the usual vegetable.
It is in the nightshade family, you know.
The potato may be eaten now.
It's a red, red tomato.
It's a red, red roasted tomato.
Now that is a proper breakfast.
That should stop its incessant flapping.
Simply exquisite.
These should tide me over.
Cooked fish in a crunchy shell.
It's soiled my good gloves.
Has a bit of a kick to it.
This would pair great with a simple cheese plate.
Tender.
These look childish, but they're delicious.
Cooked to perfection.
There'll be no more crying out of you.
My compliments to the chef!
Leave no scrap unused.
It would be unwise to ingest this.
I made it, so you know it's good.
What foul product of science is this?
It's been eons since I had a good biscuit.
Roughage.
A meal fit for a king... or at least someone with a throne.
It's almost entirely sugar.
How festive.
It will have to do.
An excellent start to the morning. Or evening.
How uncultured.
Leafy goodness.
There's a mole in the mix.
Sundae, sundae, sundae!
The case is cold on the melon.
Hot as heck!
Nuts and berries. No bolts.
Hm.. I don't know what I was expecting.
Excellent food, but the ambiance could be improved.
We meet again, crabbit.
A delightful, cultured dish.
I look forward to this.
Hm... I don't think this meshes well with my cultivated look.
Ah, I do enjoy the finer things.
And here I forgot my bib.
It looks passable.
My refined palate relishes the taste of endangerment.
A very balanced meal, I suppose.
Deserves to be eaten with fine silverware. Sadly, I've just my hands.
It's less than appetizing.
I truly look forward to a full meal.
Why, this looks halfway palatable!
A meal fitting of my stature.
Hm... Needs more fish.
I suppose you can make soup from anything.
Am I hungry enough for this?
Cake with the texture of tar.
At least the shells are fresh.
Refreshing.
Innocuous inoculation.
It's a rather weak broth.
I do enjoy a drink.
They're obviously grilled.
A spot of tea.
This would be great with a simple cheese plate.
They look superb.
What foul manifestation of evil is this?
I think there's seventeen in there.
It's hearty and filling.
I'll permit him to stay so long as he keeps cooking.
At the end of the day, it's still frog.
It smells much nicer going in than coming back out.
What a nice change it is to know someone who cooks.
I do love mashed potatoes.
I've never had it before.
I'm going to have dreams about this pie nightmare.
Pops right into my mouth!
It's so delicate.
What an odd way to serve potatoes.
A bit spicy for my delicate palate.
Just because I'm old doesn't mean I like gelatin.
I suppose these won't plant themselves.
This labour is beneath me.
I broiled the life out of 'em.
Sticky and sweet.
Ha ha ha. I got him!
Some puns are irresistible.
That used to be food until I wasted it.
Disgusting. Why am I carrying this around?
I need to put on gloves for this.
Over an open fire.
It's charged with nutrients.
I could probably plant these.
I believe I can... eat it.
Now I can harness its thoughtpower for myself.
Perhaps something will grow if I shove these in the ground.
I suppose I'm the domestic help now.

Flytrap StalkFlytrap Stalk- 
All stalk and no action.

Magic WaterMagic Water- 
What an invigorating little seed.

Asparagus SeedsAsparagus Seeds- 

Radish SeedsRadish Seeds- 

Tuber SeedsTuber Seeds- 

Don't Starve Together
Carrot SeedsCorn SeedsDragon Fruit SeedsDurian SeedsEggplant SeedsPomegranate SeedsPumpkin SeedsSeeds (specific)- 
Such labor is beneath me.
Broiled the life out of 'em.
Disgusting. Why keep this around?
Unsettlingly wobbly.
Am I supposed to plant these?
Am I supposed to plant these?
Am I supposed to plant these?
Am I supposed to plant these?
Am I supposed to plant these?
I know all about that. I just forgot.
My pets! What has become of you?
A fine powder that smells of destruction.
My trip through the portal made it unrecognizable.
Red brings fire.
Blue brings ice.
I can feel the magic in this.
The nightmare fuel will unlock its true potential.
This will be quite powerful with some fuel.
Hirsute.
It's the way of all mortal life.
Disgusting!
These must have been heated to an incredible temperature.
This was important to someone once.
A tangled mess. Like life.
Don't look at me like that.
A toy for a child's mind.
Just useless old wires.
Not something a grown man should be caught playing with.
I'd prefer a pocketwatch on a chain.
My suits don't deserve to be defaced with these tacky atrocities.
These are gross, and that's the tooth.
I'm not listening.
I’m not touching that without several pairs of gloves.
I'm so sorry Charlie.
I need some nightmare fuel.
I have a headache!
That should chase the shadows away.
Don't think you'll be able to escape that easily.
Grind them bones.
Never sell your sole for forbidden knowledge.
Could this be the cure?
The clinking sound when they rub together is intensely satisfying.
Slightly chilly.
What's this primitive communication?
I believe I should dispose of this.
Perhaps I could turn a profit with this.
How barbaric.
A fork fit for ocean royalty.
Good for whacking.
A welcome change from seawater.
This seems like bad voodoo.
It only has four strings.
Letters and numbers... some sort of secret code?
A little superglue and it would make a lovely centerpiece.
Neither red nor blue.
Looks like something one would find at a backwater flea market.
It's not communicating with anyone now.
I would look quite dashing in it, were my ear pierced.
It was probably hideous before soaking in bilgewater.
Exactly what it looks like. Err... What does it look like?
Might be nice in a hot bath...
It has no apparent function.
An advanced little gadget.
Just common iron.
Brittle.
A key of fine gold.
The inside is filthy.
Petty change.
What use have I for coin out here?
Finally some reasonable pocket change.
Destructive. I like it.
Someone might desire this.
This might catch a pretty penny.
Where's the rest of the face?
Looks regal.
It's absurd what passes as valuable around here.
Now I can control those insects.
Durable.
We all have our defenses.
Much easier on my knees.
Finally a roof over my head.
I shall be a great leader.
This seems rather ornate.
Building a city is a step down for me.
Why would I want this horrible looking thing?
A keepsake for the Boar-geoisie.
Really. Is that necessary?
I know all about that. I... just forgot.
I can sense magic in it.
Only the nightmare fuel will unlock its true potential.
A complete and utter fraud...
I might hide those in WX-78's bedroll if I get bored.
Is that a crack about my age?
Reminds me of the good ol' days.
How vile.
Hm? What a familiar presence.
I can sense strong magic within it.
This enchantment is not of my doing.
Whatever it is will be arriving soon.
I should quit toying with this now.
It demands a sacrifice.
Ah. How have you been, Lucy?
Those look much too jovial for my liking.
This seems out of place here. Too cheery.
A rare blueprint, indeed.
Not enough for a rug.
I'll need somewhere to sculpt it.
What forbidden fishing knowledge do you hold?
It's strange to see it.
A pulse of malice and betrayal beats within.
Don't look at me like that.
Perhaps I'll invite Ms. Wickerbottom for a nice mandrake tea.
Charlie was the only one who ever kept me in check.
The product of a very immature magician, perhaps.
A metaphor, perhaps.
Admittedly, it's difficult to maintain balance when you're on top.
Eliminates the need for the phrase 
I know when I've been beaten.
The monster child gets tangled in this frequently.
I was looking for that.
Not a pawn, but still a minion.
It's been beheaded.
The strongman's wardrobe is filled to the brim with these, judging from the odor.
This was important to one very specific person once.
It is still beholden to the king.
Finally. My suits were getting wrinkles. Wrinkles!
That reminds me, I must practice my cold glare tonight!
It's useful for keeping in contact with my... acquaintances.
Its aura can be felt from anywhere. Quite useful.
I have a feeling of being watched, even from a considerable distance away.
A decent enough use of the gem's power, I suppose.
A conveniently color-coded place marker.
A sizable magic gem.
The charge has made it incredibly powerful.
An impressively condensed point of freezing magic.
I'll cross it off my bucket list.
There's something inside it.
I of all people should be able to do this.
The portals lead to the next rod.
I can use this to find my missing parts.
Mostly just background noise.
This is the right direction.
I should keep my eyes peeled.
It must be right under my nose!
It's the starting mechanism.
I need to insert the divining rod.
Progress!
So that's where I left that thing!
That accursed thing!
Aw, it remembers me.
Now that's a fine statue.
I'm sure I had my reasons when I placed this.

Sick Worm HoleSick Worm Hole- 
It looks ill.
It keeps the master in the chair.
It's less painful than it looks. Barely.
Better him than me.
Better her than me.
Better it than me.
It seems silly now...
I'm... sure I had my reasons when I placed this.
You tell me.
Freedom, at last!
My heart grows cold.
To arms!
You look tasty!
Brains over brawn!
I'll not be made a fool of!
You've forced my hand!
And stay away!
You're not worth my time!
Next time, pig!
I won't be made a fool of... next time!
Next time the gloves come off!
Killing me won't bring back your honey!
It'll be dark soon. Charlie will be waking up.
It's dark! I can't see!
The light is back.
I can't see in the dark!
That didn't work.
Er... I can't do that.
I should think not.
I can't sleep in the day.
Sleeping now would mess up my sleep schedule!
I'm too hungry. I can't sleep.
Not while there's danger afoot!
It's busy, currently.
The dead have no need of such things.
It's thoroughly unconscious.
It perked up just a tiny bit.
The hounds are growing restless.
Something terrible cometh.
I hear one of them coming.
My pockets are full.
Curses.
It wouldn't fit.
That can't go in there.
Nothing ever goes as planned.
I must get closer.
That's unshavable.
But it's already as smooth as a baby's rear end.
I don't think she'd take kindly to that.
I'm unable to do that right now.
Perhaps I should take a step back.
Even with my long arms, I still can't reach.
(Gulp!)
That was past its due-date.
That was putrid.
Ow! That hurt my mouth!
I am empty inside.
Ack!
Dang it, another light down.
Eventually the firefly will starve.
I scratched my arms up doing that.
I think I can fix this!
That rumbling can't be good.
Can't touch this!
My heart can't stand the heat!
Protect me, cursed tree!
Damp is not dapper.
Water'll ruin a good suit, you know?
I don't think I'll ever be dry again.
Wetter than water itself.
Slip-sliding away.
Won't be long before it lights on fire.
It burns!
I hear one of them coming.
That might not be the best idea.
That rumbling can't be good.
There's no need for such an outburst.
It seems I'm being pursued.
The hounds are growing restless.
I hear one of them coming.
I want nothing to do with mists and fogs.
I am consumed by the abyss!
Thank goodness.
Truly!
My vessel is sustaining damage.
I fear I've sprung a leak.
After everything, is this how it ends?!
The net is full to bursting!
Crafty crustacean...
I don't believe this treasure is located nearby.

Hay Fever starting- 
Ugh. Allergies.
Ah... I can breathe again.
I AM SUPERIOR!

How apropos.
Sacrifice yourself for my comfort!
That smell... both nostalgic and terrifying!
Thank goodness for the light.
I can't sleep during daylight hours.
Oh dear. I know what's making that sound.
Drat.
One pet is enough responsibility.
The cycle begins again.
You do not belong in MY world!
oOooooOO!!
Say, pal, you don't look so good.
Once again the seat of power is stolen from me!
We've sprung a leak!
Oh dear.
I am far too advanced for this.
There's a lesson to be learned about tampering with secret knowledge.
I seem to be in the wrong place to use this.
It's not going to work in here.
I don't like sharing.
That's the wrong part.
Well I need something to build with.
It needs completely different plans.
Hmph. You're adding too much salt.
I'm quite adept at waiting. I've had a lot of practice.
Worry not, pal. I've the patience of a saint.
I have more important things to do than that.
I can wait... it's the courteous thing to do.
I could have told you that wouldn't fit.
Hm. No, that's not right.
The ceiling is going to collapse!
The compass has fallen to pieces.
I must be ever vigilant!
Say, pal, I don't look so good...
I had to try.
I don't think so. They might still be mad.
Am I supposed to come running every time I spot a flare?
They're whispering through the core of my mind...!
I must wait and regain my strength.
Time to beat a hasty retreat!
The coward has summoned its minions.
Blast! Wrong key.
I'll not be done in by an overgrown Krampus.
It's about time.
I hear you in there.
I must have your knowledge.
A-ha!
A living log would be more suited to this.
A mushroom would be more suited to this.
Even The Amazing Maxwell couldn't wring magic from that.
That would be an amateurish misuse of its magic.
How putrid!
That takes care of that.
I won't let that anywhere near my mouth.
A civilized man does not eat such things.
Oh, this should be good.
When you have a moment.
The dead have no need of such things.
No sense giving them more than they can carry.
Err... I'll let you rest.
That's a terrible idea right now.
I'm not opening that on top of this thing.
No need to do it twice.
I can't do that while it's covered in moon glass.
You're kidding right?
My suit is drenched in salt water.
There goes my respite.
There are plenty of birds here already.
I must wait before I summon the birds again.
I need to pass the time somehow.
Ah. The satisfaction of a job well done.
I just need to find my beautiful assistant.
Say, pal, I don't look so good.
The poor unsuspecting fool has no idea what's coming.
Naughty. Definitely naughty.
I've faced worse ordeals.
All those who oppose me shall perish!
The thorned rose cannot help but prick. It is its nature.
There is magic in the trees.
Everything I make is magnificent.
Hmph.
I never was one to shy away from theatrics, or a good suit.
Volcanic power is intoxicating.
Hey, handsome.
That's one snazzy chest.
That chest is calling to me.
I'm not sure this was a good investment.
It's not going anywhere.
There's no place like it.
That's not how you use a boat!
I can't get through there.
That's just nasty.
Dusty.
That's not doing anyone any good.
The top of this lava pit has cooled into a fine crust.
It's hot.
The fires are cooling.
It looks harmless.
Maybe I shouldn't have put that there.
What annoying little bugs.
Hmmm. Looks suspicious.
Odd. They forgot to set it.
Just what are you up to now, Charlie?
Hmm, not quite done.

It's useless when cold.
Comfortably warm.
It's almost too hot to hold.
It smells... noxious.
Tufty.
Someone has made a mess of the ocean.
What a disgusting home.
Once a proud race...
Mechanical refuse.
There's a reason I never finished that.
They were all dead when I got here.
How quickly they forget...
What a slobbering fool.
This was important to someone once.
My brain swells with power!
Knowledge is power. And power is... well, power.
That wasn't very informative.
Protect me, tree!
I hope you are ready.
Farewell.
Holding it makes me feel like a tourist.
What a strange little organism.
I found that wholly unenjoyable. I swear. What?
This projectile flinger may come in handy.
I've made sure it packs an extra wallop.
Projectile flame. I quite like it.

Just useless sticks unless we assemble it.
Any way to improve the food around here is welcome.
Nothing quite like Mumsy's milk.
I presume I pour this on something.
I have use for this.
I didn't make that one.
Ah. A crab of some stature.
Intriging.
What has brought this blight upon my world?
It's sickly and frail.
Charlie didn't make that one!

Now there's nothing for it but to rot. Or is there?
Sautéed to take the civilized route.
Now bereft of moisture but not of moral ambiguity.
I might hide those in the robot's bedroll if I get bored.
Perhaps I'll invite the librarian for a nice mandrake tea.
Now is the time to strike!
It fled back into the earth.
Even THEY couldn't build something so devious.
That kinda makes it all worthwhile.
